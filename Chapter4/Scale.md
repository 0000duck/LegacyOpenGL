## Scaling
Scaling in its most simple definition increases or decreases the size of an object or coordinate system. Scaling is pretty self explanatory, i'm not going to spend too much time on it.

The function looks like this

```
void GL.Scale(float x, float y, float z); 
```

Go ahead and make a sample like we did with Translation and rotation. Try scaling big (2.0, 2.0, 2.0), also try scaling small (0.25, 0.25, 0.25)
