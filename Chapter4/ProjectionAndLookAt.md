# The missing functions
One of the nice things about being able to use your own matrices in OpenGL is having to rely less on the OpenGL functions. After all, you don't really know what those functions are doing under the hood! If we want to fully break away from OpenGL we have timplement 3 more functions into our Matrix4 class: Ortho, Frustum and LookAt.

Make these changes in the __Math Implementation__ repository, once they are working, copy the Matrix4.cs file into your __OpenGL1X__ repository, replacing the old file.

All three of these functions are going to be static!

## Frustum
