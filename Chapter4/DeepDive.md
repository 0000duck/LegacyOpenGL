#Transformation Pipeline Deep Dive
The problem with most books is that they glaze over the transformation pipeline. This is bad! The Transformation Pipeline is the heart of 3D rendering! I really, really need you to understand how it works!

[This article](http://www.codinglabs.net/article_world_view_projection_matrix.aspx) does a much better job of explaining how the transformation pipeline works than i can. Bookmark it, print it if you have to; but read it and take it to heart. If you are still confused at the end of this chapter, reread that article and talk to me!
