#Transformations And Matrices

Now it's time to take a short break from learning how to _create_ 3D Objects in the world and focus on learning hot to _move_ the objects around in the world. This is vital to generating realistic 3D worlds! Withou this the 3D scenes you create would be static and non-interactive. 

OpenGL makes it easy for the programmer to move objects around trough the use of various _coordinate transformations_, discussed in this chapter. You will also take a look at how to use your own matrices with OpenGL, which provides you with the power to manipulate objects in many different ways.

In this chapter you will learn about
* The basics of coordinate transformations
* The camera and viewing transformations
* OpenGL matrices and matrix stacks
* Projections
* Using your own matrices with OpenGL

If you need a refresher on the matrix math implementation details, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6sJpjYzfaQ) video appears to be useful.
