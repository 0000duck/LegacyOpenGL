# Custom Matrices
Using OpenGL matrix functions is pretty easy. And the stack makes working with matrices even easyer. But you already have a Matrix class built. Which already offers everything OpenGL matrices offer, and more! 

Tour matrices are also a bit easyer to work with than OpenGL's because you have full control and know they are mathematically accurate. Wouldn't it be great if you could use your own matrices to work with OpenGL?

Good news, you can!
