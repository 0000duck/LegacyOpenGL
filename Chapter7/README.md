# Texture mapping
Nothing we have discussed so far can bring as much realism to a 3D scene as texture mapping. Lighting comes close, but it doesn't have near the impact a simple texture map can have when applied to a set of polygons.  In this chapter you will learn to achieve a high level of realism trough an introduction to the concept and implementation of texture mapping techniques in OpenGL.

In this chapter you will learn:

* The basics of texture mapping
* Texture coordinates
* Texture objects and texture binding
* Texture specifications with 1D, 2D, 3D and cube map textures
* Texture filtering
* Mipmaps and auto mip generation
* Texture paramaters
* Wrap modes
* Level of details
* Texture environments and functions
