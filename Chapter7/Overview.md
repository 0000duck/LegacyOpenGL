# An overview of texture mapping

In a nutshell _texture mapping_ allows you to attach images to polygons in order to provide more realistic graphics. As an example, you could apply an image of the front of a book to a rectangular polygon; the polygon would appear as a visual representation of the front of the book. Another example would be to take a map of earth and texture map it to a sphere. You then have a 3D visual representation of earth. Nowdays, texture maps are used everywhere in 3D graphics, you're gonna have a hard time finding a game that doest use textures.

Texture maps are composed of rectengular arrays of date, each element of these arrays is called a __texel__
