# Billboarding

Billboarding is a technique of making polygons always face the viewer. Why is this useful? Suppose we're making an outdoor scene. There are trees, LOTS of trees. They have LOTS of polygons. But far away trees have little detail to them. You could replace far away trees with textured quads that always face the camera.

Changes are the player wouldn't even notice this. I can't, here is an example:

In some games everything may be billboarded:
