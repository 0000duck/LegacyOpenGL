First, this isn't the end of our OpenGL journey. We will revisit OpenGL later with "Modern OpenGL" (as opposed to legacy). We're also going to revisit OpenGL for "Animations".

However graphics programming is vast. I decided to include a section on commonly used techniques, that you will not need to implement (this whole section is a read-along); but you should still know how they work.

Most of these i have not implemented myself, but they come up in conversation. I usually have to google these, sometimes you can find them on youtube, or in online tutorials.
