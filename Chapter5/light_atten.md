# Attenuation
In the real world, the farther an object is away from a light, the less effect that light has on the object. For example, if you look at a street lamp at night (especialy in the fog) you'll be able to see the intensity of the light dropping off away from the lamp. This phenomenon is known as _attenuation_.
