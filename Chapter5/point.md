#Point Lights  
The code for point lights is very similar to the code for directional lights. You can think of a directional light as the sun, a point light is more like a light-bulb. It's a point in space that emits light, the further the light gets from the point, the less it's influance is. Unlike directional lights, point lights do have a position, which means the matrix stack and the model-view matrix become incredibly important.
