# Spotlights
Normally positional lights radiate in all directions. However you can limit the effect of the line to a cone. This would look like a flash light, the effect is called a _spotlight_.

To create a spotlight, you set up a positional light like you normally would and then set a few spotlight-specific paramaters: cutoff, direction and focus.
