#Introduction
This tutorial is about learning OpenGL trough C# with the OpenTK wrapper. The book mostly follows along with [Beginning OpenGL Game Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-OpenGL-Game-Programming-Astle/dp/1592003699/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453020847&sr=1-2&keywords=Beginning+OpenGL+Game+Programming), first edition. Some parts more closly resemble [OpenGL Distilled](http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Distilled-Paul-Martz/dp/0321336798) and there is code in here taken from [The red book](http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Programming-Guide-Official-Learning/dp/0321773039/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453020928&sr=1-1&keywords=opengl+programming+guide), second edition.
