(SGI) as a multi-purpose platform-independent graphics API. Since 1992, the developent of OpenGL has been overseen by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB), which is made up of graphics vendors and other industry leaders such as ATI, Dell, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, etc... The role of the ARB is to establish and maintain the OpenGL specification which dictate which features must be included when one is developing an OpenGL distribution.\n"},"Chapter1/OpenGL.html":{"url":"Chapter1/OpenGL.html","title":"OpenGL","body":"OpenGL History\nThe current OpenGL version is 4.5. OpenGL 4.5 will continue to be developed but the API is branching off into a more modern API called Vulkan. The two will both be maintained for some time, until the old OpenGL api is phased out.\nWe are going to cover OpenGL 1.5. It is an older version of the API, but it&#39;s the perfect introduction into 3D graphics. It&#39;s easy to use and understand. We will delve into more modern versions of the API later.\nThe designers of OpenGL knew that hardware vendors would want to add features that may not be exposed by default to the OpenGL interface. To address this they included a method for extending OpenGL. Hardware vendors can create OpenGL extensions. When other vendors start implementing the functionality as well and the extension gains enough support it is submitted for review to the ARB. It is up to the ARB to promote the extension into the core specification of OpenGL.\nBy default the framework we will use to access OpenGL, OpenTK exposes extensions to us. We do not need to worry about having to manualy load them.\nSoftware V Hardware\nInitially OpenGL 1.0 was a software renderer. It would crunch numbers, do math and &quot;render&quot; a 3D scene all on the CPU. Right around 1998 graphics cards started getting more and more popular. Graphics cards have specialized chips on them that can perform simple matrix math MUCH faster than the CPU can.\nOpenGL 1.0 was able to use the GPU to render using Extensions. Hardware transform &amp; lighting was promoted to core in OpenGL 1.1. By OpenGL 1.5 all graphics calulations happen on the GPU\nOpenGL Architecture\nOpenGL is a collection of several hundred functions providing access to all the features offered by your graphics card. Internally OpenGL functions as a state machine, a collection of states that tell the OpenGL what to do and are changed in a very well-defined manner. Using the OpenGL API you can set various aspects of the state machine, including things such as the current color, lighting and blending.\nWhen rendering, everything drawn is drawn according to the rules set inside the OpenGL statemachine. It&#39;s important to be aware of what the various states are and how they effect what gets rendered. It is not uncommon at all to get a black screen with nothing being rendered simply because you forgot to set a single state. Graphics Programming is pretty finicky, and you kind of need to know what you are doing.\n"},"Chapter1/OpenTK.html":{"url":"Chapter1/OpenTK.html","title":"OpenTK","body":"OpenTK\nWhat is OpenTK? The Open Toolkit is an advanced, low-level C# library that wraps OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL. It is suitable for games, scientific applications and any other project that requires 3d graphics, audio or compute functionality.\nWhat this means is OpenTK takes several low level C libraries (OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL) and exposes them to as a higher level C# Interface.\nOther options\nOpenTK is not the only C# binding of OpenGL. There are a lot of others to choose from. The most notable one is the TAO framework.\nWith other options, why use OpenTK? First, it&#39;s the most activeley supported binding. More importantly, OpenTK attempts to leverage the language design of C# to solve issues that OpenGL has inherited from C. This is something no other binding is doing.\nProblem with C\nOpenGL is nativly implemented as a C-API. C does not have Objects, only functions and memory. As such the API can be hard to navidate. For example, every state switch is one big enumeration. This means the following states (GL_TRIANGLE, GL_QUAD, GL_COLOR_BIT) are all really integers. So given the following function:\nvoid glBegin(int primitiveState);\nWhich of the above states is valid here? GL_TRIANGLE and GL_QUAD are. The only way to know that is to go trough the docs. What happens if you pass GL_COLOR_BIT to the function? Nothing renders!\nAs you can imagine intellisense is of no help either. The second you type GL_ about 500 options pop up. There is no indication what is appropriate and what is not.\nSolution with C-Sharp\nTo solve this problem OpenTK defines it&#39;s own enumerations. Many of them, that map to the huge list of C enumerations. For Instance, in OpenTK havs the following enum:\nenum PrimitiveType { GL_TRIANGLE, GL_QUAD, GL_FAN };\nNow when you look at this function\nvoid glBegin(PrimitiveType primitiveState);\nVisual studios intellisense will tell you that the argument is of type PrimitiveType and when you type in PrimitiveType. intellisense will pop up only the relevant items in the correct enumeration\nOther improvements\nOpenTK is filled with other similar improvements that make writing OpenGL programs in C# much faster and less error prone than writing them in C. The OpenTK framework is available in Visual Studio&#39;s package manager NuGet.\nTake some time and check out the official website which has some cool guides and nifty code samples.Definateley take a peek at the OpenTK docs which are written in a book-like fashion.\n"},"Chapter2/Introduction.html":{"url":"Chapter2/Introduction.html","title":"Getting a window","body":"Getting a window\nOne of the most important things we need to do is have a window where we can actually see what gets renderd. this section will walk you trough the deatils of an OpenTK window.\nSome of it might look familiar, the 2DOpenTKFramework projects use this same code.\n"},"Chapter2/Setup.html":{"url":"Chapter2/Setup.html","title":"Setting up the window","body":"Getting a window\nMost of this is going to look familiar. We  used OpenTK to manage windows in the OpenTK2DFramework project. This chapter just provides more detailed information about what is happening.\nThe OpenTK namespace contains the GameWindow class. OpenTK can either manage the game window for you, or be embedded in a windows forms application. For the sake of speed, we will let OpenTK create and manage the main window for us. This is the minimum code to get a window up and running:\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        // global reference\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null; \n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n            //create static (global) window instance\n            // take note, we set make a new MainGameWindow object, which inherits from OpenTK.GameWindow\n            Window = new MainGameWindow();\n\n            //run game at 60fps. will not return until window is closed\n            Window.Run(60.0f);\n\n            // We are finished with the window, clean up memory\n            Window.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhat happened?\nWe created a static variable called Window of type OpenTK.GameWindow. This is a public static variable to allow global access. If you don&#39;t need to access the window from outside your class you could have that variable be local to the Main function. It doesn&#39;t have to be static.\nThe Main function has to be marked as STAThread as with other non-form C# applications. \nThe first line of Main,  Window = new MainGameWindow(); creates a new window object. When created, the window object allocates memory for the new window and intializes everything the window needs.\nWhy do we create a MainGameWindow object instead of a raw OpenTK.GameWindow object? Because the MainGameWindow extends the OpenTK.GameWindow class this will work. For now you could replace that with a new OpenTK.GameWindow()  call and everything would still work. But later we will need to override methods in the OpenTK.GameWindow class.\nThe next line Window.Run(60.0f); actually shows the window. After the window is shown this method will enter the update loop. The window will try to run at 60FPS if it can. The actual update speed is up to you.\nThe Run method of the window only returns when the window is closed. For the duration of the application this method will be executing.\nOnce the window is closed and Run returns we have to clean up any memory it allocated and all resources it&#39;s eating up. That&#39;s what the Dispose method does.\n"},"Chapter2/Callbacks.html":{"url":"Chapter2/Callbacks.html","title":"Using callbacks","body":"Callbacks\nIn OpenTK you don&#39;t have access to the windows message loop. Instead OpenTK provides a number of very useful callbacks that you can use to do things during the lifecycle of the window. Set all of the callbacks before calling the Run method of the window.\nInitialize\nThe initialize function gets called right after the window is created, before the windows first update / render cycle. \nThe function takes a sender object and a EventArgs event, it returns void. This is how you can hook up the Initialize callback:\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        //reference to OpenTK window\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null; \n\n        public static void Initialize(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n            // Do initialization code here\n        }\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n            //create static(global) window instance\n            Window = new MainGameWindow();\n\n            //hook up the initialize callback\n            Window.Load += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Initialize);\n\n            //set window title and size\n            Window.Title = &quot;Game Name&quot;;\n            Window.ClientSize = new Size(800, 600);\n\n            // turn on vsynch, prevents screen tearing when swapping buffers\n            // This is on by default, but take no changes!\n            Window.VSync = VSyncMode.On;\n\n            //run game at 60fps. will not return until window is closed\n            Window.Run(60.0f);\n            Window.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUpdate\nThe Update function gets called 1 time every frame. The function takes a sender object and a FrameEventArgs event, it returns void. You need to hook up to the UpdateFrame method of the OpenTK window.\nYou can get the delta time of the update loop trough the FrameEventArgs argument of the function.\n// ...\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        // ...\n\n        public static void Update(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            float deltaTime = (float)e.Time;\n        }\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n            // ...\n\n            Window.UpdateFrame += new EventHandler&lt;FrameEventArgs&gt;(Update);\n\n            // ...\n\n            Window.Run(60.0f);\n            Window.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nRender\nThe Render function is similar to the Update function. The function gets hooked up to the windows RenderFrame callback. Just like Update the Render function takes a sender object and a FrameEventArgs event, it returns void.\nBecause the second argument is a FrameEventArgs event you can access delta time the same way you did for Update if you need it, tough generally in a Render function you wont.\nInside this function we need to do the following\n\nTell OpenGL what color to clear the screen to\nClear the screen\nRender our game\nSwap the back and front display buffers\nThese are managed by OpenTK.\nOpenTK is by default double buffered.\n\n\n\nThis code contains the first two lines of OpenGL we are going to write. Don&#39;t worry about what they mean yet, for now just copy them in.\n// ...\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null; \n\n        // ...\n\n        public static void Render(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            // Tell OpenGL what color to clear the screen to\n            GL.ClearColor(Color.CadetBlue);\n            // Tell OpenGL to clear the screen.\n            GL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.ColorBufferBit | ClearBufferMask.DepthBufferBit);\n\n            // TODO: Render your game here\n\n            Window.SwapBuffers();\n        }\n\n        // ..\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n            // ...\n\n            Window.RenderFrame += new EventHandler&lt;FrameEventArgs&gt;(Render);\n\n            // ...\n\n            Window.Run(60.0f);\n            Window.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nResize\nThe resize callback is a bit special. Not in the good way. This callback is the whole reason that our MainGameWindow class has to extend the OpenTK.GameWindow class. \nResize does not have a callback event, instead the OpenTK.GameWindow class implements it as a virtual function that we must override. This function will take a EventArgs event for an argument and return void.\nGetting the width and height of the window on resize is also a bit dumb. That information is not passed in with the event argument (practicaly nothing is!). Instead you must check a variable called ClientRectangle that is inherited from OpenTK.Window. ClientRectangle is a System.Drawing.Rectangle object.\n// ...\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n\n        // ...\n\n        protected override void OnResize(EventArgs e) {\n            // You must call this!\n            base.OnResize(e);\n\n            // ClientRectangle is inherited from OpenTK.GameWindow\n            Rectangle drawingArea = ClientRectangle;\n\n            // Do resize window stuff here\n        }\n\n        // ...\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n\n            // ...\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShutdown\nThe shutdown callback is similar to the initialize callback. The function takes a sender object and a EventArgs event, it returns void. You hook shutdown up the the windows Unload callback\n// ...\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n\n        // ...\n\n        public static void Shutdown(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n\n        }\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n\n            // ...\n\n            Window.Unload += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Shutdown);\n\n            // ...\n\n            Window.Run(60.0f);\n            Window.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAll together\nThe code below puts all of the above callbacks in place. IT also sets the window Title and Size, trough public getters and setters exposed to the GameWindow class. This should be everything we need for the main window.\nIf you&#39;re curious, a complete list of the callbacks and properties of the GameWindow class can be found on the OpenTK Doxygen documentation page.\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        //reference to OpenTK window\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null; \n\n        public static void Initialize(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n\n        }\n\n        public static void Update(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            float deltaTime = (float)e.Time;\n        }\n\n        public static void Render(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            GL.ClearColor(Color.CadetBlue);\n            GL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.ColorBufferBit | ClearBufferMask.DepthBufferBit);\n\n            // TODO: Render your game here\n\n            Window.SwapBuffers();\n        }\n\n        protected override void OnResize(EventArgs e) {\n            // You must call this!\n            base.OnResize(e);\n\n            // ClientRectangle is inherited from OpenTK.GameWindow\n            Rectangle drawingArea = ClientRectangle;\n        }\n\n        public static void Shutdown(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n\n        }\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n            //create static(global) window instance\n            Window = new MainGameWindow();\n\n            //hook up the initialize callback\n            Window.Load += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Initialize);\n            //hook up the update callback\n            Window.UpdateFrame += new EventHandler&lt;FrameEventArgs&gt;(Update);\n            //hook up render callback\n            Window.RenderFrame += new EventHandler&lt;FrameEventArgs&gt;(Render);\n            //hook up shutdown callback\n            Window.Unload += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Shutdown);\n\n            //set window title and size\n            Window.Title = &quot;Game Name&quot;;\n            Window.ClientSize = new Size(800, 600);\n\n            // turn on vsynch, prevents screen tearing when swapping buffers\n            // This is on by default, but take no changes!\n            Window.VSync = VSyncMode.On;\n\n            //run game at 60fps. will not return until window is closed\n            Window.Run(60.0f);\n\n            Window.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n"},"Chapter2/FullScreen.html":{"url":"Chapter2/FullScreen.html","title":"Going fullscreen","body":"Full Screen\nMost games have the ability to switch between full screen mode and windowed mode. A lot of times this is implemented as a menu option. It used to be standard to toggle fullscreen mod with the Alt+Enter shortcut, however that trent has been slowly dying out. \nHow you want to implement your fullscreen toggle logic is up to you, i&#39;m just going to show you how to actually toggle. If you end up accidentally going into fullscreen mode press Alt+Tab to bring up the program selection toolbox. Navigate to Visual studio (Keep alt pressed down while tapping the tab button to move between programs) and use the red square to terminate the application.\nAPI\nWe can switch our game to fullscreen mode by setting a few variables inherited from OpenTK.GameWindow.\nFirst, we need to set the WindowBorder variable. It is an enum of type WindowBorder. The values that interest us are WindowBorder.Resizable for a regular window and WindowBorder.Hidden for a fullscreen window.\nNext, we want to set the WindowState variable. It is an enum of type WindowState. The values that we care about are WindowState.Normal for windowed mode and WindowState.Fullscreen for fullscreen mode.\nOne last thing, when going from fullscreen to windowed mode you need to reset the client size the same way you did when we first created the window:\nClientSize = new Size(800, 600);\n\nFailure to do so will result in undefined behaviour. On my machine the window shrinks by 1 pixel every frame until it has a sie of 0\nImplementation\nThe first thing we need to do is add a new boolean to the MainGameWindow class to keep track of the current window mode (windowed or full screen).\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\nusing GameFramework;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        // reference to OpenTK window\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null;\n\n        // keep track of window mode\n        public static bool IsFullscreen = false;\n\nNext we implement the actual toggle function\n        public static void ToggleFullscreen() {\n            if (IsFullscreen) {\n                Window.WindowBorder = WindowBorder.Resizable;\n                Window.WindowState = WindowState.Normal;\n                Window.ClientSize = new Size(800, 600);\n            }\n            else {\n                Window.WindowBorder = WindowBorder.Hidden;\n                Window.WindowState = WindowState.Fullscreen;\n            }\n            IsFullscreen = !IsFullscreen;\n        }\n\n        // ... Rest of MainGameWindow class\n\nKeep in mind, when exiting fullscreen mode you MUST reset the window to its original size, otherwise the behaviour is undefined. \nThat&#39;s it. You can now call the ToggleFullscreen function from a menu, or hook it up to Alt+Enter your call.\n"},"Chapter2/YourCode.html":{"url":"Chapter2/YourCode.html","title":"Your code","body":"Running your code\nNow that you have a window set up, running with a blue clear screen (run the game, make sure you do!) the question is where should you write game code?\nTurns out that question has a LOT of answers. You need to be able to choose the fastest solution, the one you are most comfortable with and build your project on that.\n1) Inline\nThis is the easyest way to do things. I would only suggest writing inline code for small demo programs that you mainly use to test things out for yourself. If you expect the program to be large, don&#39;t do this.\nInline code is kind of what it sounds. The MainWindow class already has static Initialize, Update, Render and Shutdown functions. Just write your code inside of these functions and call it a day.\n2) Static Reference\nThis is my personal favorite. You don&#39;t really need anything special to make it work. Let&#39;s assume you have a Game class.\nclass Game {\n    public void Initialize() {\n\n    }\n\n    public void Update(float dt) {\n\n    }\n\n    public void Render() {\n\n    }\n\n    public void Shutdown() {\n\n    }\n}\n\nYou simply make a static reference variable to the Game class inside the MainWindow class, just like you have a Window variable referencing an OpenTK window.\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        //reference to OpenTK window\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null;\n\n        // reference to game\n        public static Game TheGame = null;\n\n        public static void Initialize(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n            TheGame.Initialize();\n        }\n\n        public static void Update(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            float deltaTime = (float)e.Time;\n            TheGame.Update(deltaTime);\n        }\n\n        public static void Render(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            GL.ClearColor(Color.CadetBlue);\n            GL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.ColorBufferBit | ClearBufferMask.DepthBufferBit);\n            TheGame.Render();\n            Window.SwapBuffers();\n        }\n\n        public static void Shutdown(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n            TheGame.Shutdown();\n        }\n\n        [STAThread]\n        public static void Main() {\n            //create static (global) window instance\n            Window = new MainGameWindow();\n\n            // create static (global) game instance\n            TheGame = new Game();\n\n            // ...\n\n3) Singleton\nThis method should be familiar by now, it&#39;s the one we used for both Mario and the DungeonCrawler project. It&#39;s very similar to approach #2, except instead of storing a static reference to the Gameclass in the MainGameWindow class you store a reference to it in the Game class trough a singleton.\nA singleton is just a static way to access a SINGLE instance of a class. We ensure a class can only have a single instance by making it&#39;s constructor private.\nclass Game() {\n    // Private constructor. \n    // Only the Game class can make a new Game instance.\n    priate Game() {\n\n    }\n\n    // Global reference to the single instance of this calss\n    private static Game instance = null;\n\n    // Public access (read only) to the game instance\n    public static Game Instance {\n        get {\n            // Lazy initialization\n            if (instance == null) {\n                // Remember, only this class can make a new instance ;)\n                instance = new Game();\n            }\n\n            return instance;\n        }\n    }\n\n"},"Chapter2/Input.html":{"url":"Chapter2/Input.html","title":"Input","body":"Input\nFor the sake of completeness i&#39;m going to show you how to read raw input here. While this is usefull, the InputManager from the GameFramework still works just fine (Assuming you set it up correctly). I highly suggest using the InputManager or rolling your own version of it.\nAfter reading this, go ahead and browse trough the InputManager class to get a better understanding of what it&#39;s doing and how it&#39;s doing it. The InputManager is just a convenient abstraction that provides buffered input instead of raw input.\nOpenTK.Input\nAll input related function reside within the OpenTK.Input namespace. This namespace has several enumerations and classes we care about:\n\nOpenTK.Input.Key\nEnumeration of keyboard keys\n\n\nOpenTK.Input.MouseButton\nEnumeration of mouse buttons\n\n\nOpenTK.Input.KeyboardState\nStructure containing keyboard information \n\n\nOpenTK.Input.MouseState\nStructure containing mouse  information \n\n\n\nFor a compleate overview of the namespace, check out the doxygen pages for OpenTK.\nKeyborad Input\nIn order to read the keyboard, all you need is access to a KeyboardState instance.\nRead this article before proceeding.\nThere above article get a KeyboardState reference using this code:\nKeyboardState state = OpenTK.Input.Keyboard.GetState();\n\nHowever this functionality is deprecated. It might get compleatly removed from future versions of OpenTK. Instead, to get a KeyboardState instance, you need access to an instance of OpenTK.GameWindow class. \nLuckly with our windowing code:\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        // reference to OpenTK window\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null;\n\nThe static variable MainGameWindow.Windowis accessable from anywhere. So, get a reference to the KeyboardState structure using the Keyboard getter of the OpenTK.GameWindow class. Like so:\n// Call somewhere in the update loop\nvoid CheckInput() {\n    KeyboardState keboard = MainGameWindow.Window.Keyboard;\n}\n\nThere is only one property of KeyboardState that we care about, and that is the fact that the [] accessor is implemented to return a bool. This override takes a OpenTK.Input.Key enum value as an argument and returns true if the button is being held down, false if it is up.\nThis is how you could check if the button A is down\n// Call somewhere in the update loop\nvoid CheckInput() {\n    KeyboardState keboard = MainGameWindow.Window.Keyboard;\n\n    if (keyboard[OpenTK.Input.Key.A]) {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;A is down&quot;);\n    }\n}\n\nWe can take advantage of the fact that each enum entry is essentially an integer and print out any key that is down:\n// Call somewhere in the update loop\nvoid CheckInput() {\n    KeyboardState keboard = MainGameWindow.Window.Keyboard;\n\n    // LastKey is the number of keys on the keyboard + 1\n    int numKeys = (int)OpenTK.Input.Key.LastKey;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numKeys; ++i) {\n        OpenTK.Input.Key iAsKey = (OpenTK.Input.Key)i;\n\n        if (keyboard[iAsKey]) {\n            Console.WriteLine(iAsKey.ToString() + &quot; is down&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMouse Input\nMouse input is similar to the keyboard input. Just like with the keyboard there are some outdated docs on the OpenTK site about working with a mouse.\nAgain, the first thing you need is an instance of the OpenTK.Input.MouseState class. You can get this trough the Mouse getter of the OpenTK.GameWindow class.\n// Call somewhere in the update loop\nvoid CheckInput() {\n    MouseState mouse = MainGameWindow.Window.Mouse;\n}\n\nJust like the KeyboardState, MouseState alos overrides the [] accessor. It takes a OpenTK.Input.MouseButton enum value as an argument. It returns true if the mouse button is down, false it it is up. You can check for a click like this:\n// Call somewhere in the update loop\nvoid CheckInput() {\n    MouseState mouse = MainGameWindow.Window.Mouse;\n\n    if (mouse[OpenTK.Input.MouseButton.Left]) {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Left Mouse Button Is Down!&quot;);\n    }\n}\n\nGetting the X and Y positions of the mouse is stupid simple. The MouseState has public X and Y accessors. They are both of type int. You can use them like this:\n// Call somewhere in the update loop\nvoid CheckInput() {\n    MouseState mouse = MainGameWindow.Window.Mouse;\n    int x = mouse.X;\n    int y = mouse.Y;\n\n    if (mouse[OpenTK.Input.MouseButton.Left]) {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Left Mouse Button Is Down!&quot;);\n    }\n\n    if (x &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 50 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 50) {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Mouse is inside Rectangle(20, 20, 50, 50)&quot;);\n    }\n}\n\nGamepad Input\nGamepad support in OpenTK is in a very sad state. It&#39;s super duper broken. I&#39;m not even going to cover it here. If you are interested, you can check out the InputManager code behind joystick support, but it&#39;s a verbose ugly hack!\nBuffered Input\nUsing the InputManager we can check more states of buttons. For example we don&#39;t just have access to a bool indicating if a key is down or up, we can also check if the key was pressed this frame, or released this frame. That&#39;s called buffered input, and it&#39;s the main high level concept that the InputManager provides.\nIf you want to implement your own buffered input, it&#39;s not difficult. The same principles that apply to double buffered rendering apply to buffered input:\n\nMake a front-buffer.\nArray of bool, size is the number of available keys\nWill hold the key states of this frame\n\n\nMake a back buffer \nArray of bool, size is the number of available keys\nWill hold the key states of the last frame\n\n\nIn update\nCopy the contents of the front-buffer INTO the back-buffer\nCopy the current keyboard state INTO the fron-buffer\n\n\nIn update, after the input buffers have been updated\nA key is down if:\nit is true in the front buffer \n\n\nA key is up if:\nit is false in the front buffer \n\n\nA key was pressed this frame if:\nit is true in the front-buffer\nit is false in the back-buffer\n\n\nA key was released this frame if:\nit is false in the front-buffer\nit is true in the back-buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code for this might look something like this:\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\nusing OpenTK.Input;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MainGameWindow : OpenTK.GameWindow {\n        public static OpenTK.GameWindow Window = null;\n\n        private static bool[] KeyboardFront = null;\n        private static bool[] KeyboardBack = null;\n\n        public static void Initialize(object sender, EventArgs e) {\n            int numKeys = (int)OpenTK.Input.Key.LastKey;\n\n            KeyboardFront = new bool[numKeys];\n            KeyboardBack = new bool[numKeys];\n\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numKeys) {\n                KeyboardFront[i] = false;\n                KeyboardBack[i] = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        private static void UpdateInput() {\n            int numKeys = (int)OpenTK.Input.Key.LastKey;\n\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numKeys; ++i) {\n                KeyboardBack[i] = KeyboardFront[i];\n            }\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; numKeys; ++i) {\n                OpenTK.Input.Key iAsKey = (OpenTK.Input.Key)i;\n                KeyboardFront[i] = Window.Keyboard[iAsKey];\n            }\n        }\n\n        private static bool KeyDown(OpenTK.Input.Key key) {\n            return KeyboardFront[key];\n        }\n\n        private static bool KeyUp(OpenTK.Input.Key key) {\n            return !KeyboardFront[key];\n        }\n\n        private static bool KeyPressed(OpenTK.Input.Key key) {\n            return KeyboardFront[key] &amp;&amp; !KeyboardBack[key];\n        }\n\n        private static bool KeyReleased(OpenTK.Input.Key key) {\n            return !KeyboardFront[key] &amp;&amp; KeyboardBack[key];\n        }\n\n        public static void Update(object sender, FrameEventArgs e) {\n            float deltaTime = (float)e.Time;\n            UpdateInput();\n            bool altDown = KeyDown(OpenTK.Input.Key.AltLeft) || KeyDown(OpenTK.Input.Key.AltRight);\n\n            if (altDown &amp;&amp; KeyPressed(OpenTK.Input.Key.Enter)) {\n                ToggleFullscreen();\n            }\n        }\n\n        // ... Rest of the MainGameWindow class\n\nThat&#39;s all it takes to implement buffered input. In this example, we use the keyboard Alt+Enter to toggle in and out of full screen. If course in general you don&#39;t want to clutter up your window with this kind of code, unless it makes sense to you. \n"},"Chapter3/Introduction.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Introduction.html","title":"OpenGL States and Primitives","body":"OpenGL States and Primitives\nNow it&#39;s time to finally get into the meat of OpenGL! To begin to unlock the power of OpenGL, you need to start with the basics and that means understanding primitives. Before we start, we need to discuss something that is going to come up during our discussion of primitives and pretty much everything else from this point on. The OpenGL state machine.\nThe OpenGL state machine consists of hundreds of settings that affect various aspects of rendering. Because the state machine will play a role in everything you do, it&#39;s important to understand what the default settings are, how you can get information about the current settings and how to change those settings. Several generic functions are used to control the state machine, so we will look at those here.\nGL\nWithin OpenTK, there is a class called GL. All OpenGL functions are implemented as static function of the GL class. For example, to begin a primitive you would:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Points);\n"},"Chapter3/StateFunctions.html":{"url":"Chapter3/StateFunctions.html","title":"State functions","body":"State functions\nOpenGL provides a number of multipurpose functions that allow you to query the OpenGL state machine. Most of these functions begin with GL.Get.... The most generic of these functions will be covered here, the rest will be covered as we use them in later chapters.\nQuerying numeric states\nThere are four general purpose functions that allow you to retrieve numeric (or Boolean) values in the OpenGL state machine:\n\nbool GL.GetBoolean(GetPName pname)\ndouble GL.GetDouble(GetPName pname)\nfloat GL.GetFloat(GetPName pname)\nint GL.GetInteger(GetPName pname)\n\nGetPName is an enumeration containing all of the states we may want to query. In each of the function, we query the state represented by it&#39;s name.\nOf course determining the current state machine settings is interesting, but not nearly as interesting as being able to change those settings. Contrary to what is expected, there is no GL.Set... or similar function for setting state machine values. Instead there is a variety of more specific functions, which we will discus as they become relevant.\nEnabling and disabling states\nWe know how to find out the states in the OpenGL state machine, so how do we turn states on and off? Enter the GL.Enable and GL.Disable functions.\nvoid GL.Enable(EnableCap enableCap);\nvoid GL.Disable(EnableCap enableCap);\nThe cap parameter represents the OpenGL capibility you want to turn on or off. GL.Enable turns it on, conversly GL.Disable turns it off. Some of the more common caps are EnableCap.Blend (for texture blending), EnableCap.Texture2D (for texturing) and EnableCap.Lighting for lighting.\nGL.IsEnabled\nOften times you just want to find out weather a particular OpenGL capacity is on or off. Altough this can be done with GL.GetBoolean it&#39;s easyer to do with GL.IsEnabled.\nbool GL.IsEnabled(EnableCap enableCap);\nIt&#39;s easyer to use this function because it takes an EnableCap enum as it&#39;s argument, instead of the GetPName enum that GL.GetBoolean takes.\nQuerying string values\nYou can find out details of the OpenGL implementation being used at runtime with the following function\nstring GL.GetString(StringName name)\nThe StringName enum only has the following five properties:\n\nVendor: The returned string indicates the name of the company whose OpenGL implementation you are using. For example, the vendor string for API drivers is API Technologies Inc.\nRenderer The string contains information that usually reflects the hardware being used. For example RADEON 9800 Pro X86/MMX/3DNow!/SSE.\nVersion This string contains the version number formatted either as: major.minor or major.minor.patch, possibly followed by additional information. \nExtensions The string returned contains a space-delimited list of all of the OpenGL extensions your driver supports. This is not very useful for OpenTK.\nShadingLanguageVersion this is the version of GLSL your graphics card supports. We will not be dealing with shaders for a while, for now this is safe to ignore.\n\nIt&#39;s good practice to print out the Vendor, Renderer and Version strings on seperate lines in your Initialize function. This will give you a feel for what hardware you are running on.\n"},"Chapter3/ErrorsAndHints.html":{"url":"Chapter3/ErrorsAndHints.html","title":"Errors and Hints","body":"Finding errors\nWhen you make an error OpenGL will usually not throw an exception, instead nothing will render. Finding errors in OpenGL is a hard task.\nPassing incorrect values to OpenGL functions causes an error flag to be set. When this happens the functions will return without actually doing anything. To track down the problem you have to query the state machine error flag, you can do so with this function:\nErrorCode GL.GetError();\nThe return values of the error are documented on OpenTK&#39;s doxygen page.\nGiving OpenGL a Hint\nSome operations in OpenGL will vary slightly from implementation to implementation (or driver to driver). An attempt was made to allow developers some form of control over these variations.\nNot all implementations follow the commend, the GL.Hint function allows you to specify you desired level of trade off between image quality and speed for several different behaviours.\nvoid GL.Hint(HintTarget target, HintMode mode)\nThe target paramater specifies the bahaviour you want to contro. The hint paramater is one of three options\n\nHintMode.Fastest is used to hint that the fastest and most efficient implementation should be used, possibly sacrificing image quality.\nHintMode.Nicest is used to indicate that the highest quality implementation should be used, even at the cost of execution speed / performance.\nHintMode.DontCare indicates that you don&#39;t have a preference. Let your OpenGL implementation decide what to use.\n\nLets take drawing a line for example.If you are drawing a few lines and you want them to be as smooth as possible, not pixelated at all you could set the following hint:\nGL.Hint(HintTarget.LineSmoothHint, HintMode.Nicest);\nIf you are rendering millions of lines for whatever reason, anti-aliasing them all will give you a huge drop in performance. You could tell OpenGL to not anti-alias them and just draw the lines jagged / pixelated with:\nGL.Hint(HintTarget.LineSmoothHint, HintMode.Fastest);\n"},"Chapter3/HandlingPrimitives.html":{"url":"Chapter3/HandlingPrimitives.html","title":"Handling Primitives","body":"Handling Primitives\nSo, what are primitives? Simply put primitives are basic geometric entities such as points, lines and triangles.\nYou will be using thousands and thousands of these primitives to make your games, so it is important to know how they work. Before we get into specific primitive types, we need to talk about a few OpenGL functions that you will be using often for working with primitives. The first is GL.Begin. The function has the following prototype:\nvoid GL.Begin(PrimitiveType mode);\nYou use GL.Begin to tell OpenGL two things:\n\nThat you are ready to start drawing\nThe primitive type you want to draw\n\nYou specify the primitive type with the PrimitiveType enum. It&#39;s values are:\n\nPrimitiveType.Points Individual points\nPrimitiveType.Lines Line segments composed of pairs of vertices\nPrimitiveType.LineStrip A series of connected lines\nPrimitiveType.LineLoop A closed loop of connected lines. The last segment is automatically created between the first and last vertices.\nPrimitiveType.Triangles Single triangles as a triplet of vertices. This is what you will use most often!\nPrimitiveType.TriangleStrip Series of connected triangles\nPrimitiveType.TriangleFan Triangle around a common, central vertex\nPrimitiveType.Quads A quadraletiral (Polygon with 4 vertices)\nPrimitiveType.QuadStrip A series of connected quadralatirals\nPrimitiveType.Polygon A convex polygon with an arbitrary number of vertices.\n\nHere is an example of what each primitive would draw like:\n\nEach call to GL.Begin needs to be accompanied by a call to GL.End, the signature of this function looks like:\nvoid GL.End();\nGL.End tells OpenGL that you are done drawing the primitive you specified with GL.Begin.\nGL.Begin() and GL.End() blocks may not be nested.\nNot all OpenGL functions can be used inside a Begin / End block. Calling an invalid function will generate a InvalidOperation error and render nothing.\nThis is a list of valid functions that can be used between Begin and End:\n\nGL.Vertex*()\nGL.Color*()\nGL.SecondaryColor*()\nGL.Index*()\nGL.Normal*()\nGL.TexCoord*()\nGL.MultiTexCoord*()\nGL.FogCoord*()\nGL.ArrayElement()\nGL_EvalCoord*()\nGL.EvalPoint*()\nGL.Material*()\nGL.EdgeFlag*()\nGL.CallList*()\nGL.CallLists*()\n\nWhy do most of those functions end in an asterisk? Because they have multiple variations. Each variation has the asterisk replaced by a number, that number signifies how many arguments the function takes.\nFor example, GL.Vertex has the following variations:\nvoid GL.Vertex2(float, float);\nvoid GL.Vertex3(float, float, float);\nvoid GL.Vertex4(float, float, float, float)\n"},"Chapter3/Vertex.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Vertex.html","title":"Vertex","body":"GL.Vertex\nLets talk about one particularly important function, the GL.Vertex function. This function needs to be called between GL.Begin and GL.End function calls. It is used to specify a point in space (A vertex), which is then interpreted appropriateley depending on the argument of GL.Begin.\nThe GL.Vertex function is so important because every object you draw with OpenGL is ultimateley described as an ordered set of vertices.\nThe version of this function you will use most often is GL.Vertex3 which takes 3 floating point arguments (x, y, z coordinates) you need to get used to this multidimensional notation.\nLets see an example:\n// Tell OpenGL we want to draw a line\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n\n// Tell OpenGL where the first point of the line is\nGL.Vertex3(2.0f, 1.0f, 3.0f);\n\n// Tell OpenGL where the second point of the line is\nGL.Vertex3(6.0f, -1.0f, 8.0f);\n\n// Tell OpenGL we are done drawing the line\nGL.End();\nEvery time you specify a vertex other data becomes associated with it based on the current state of the OpenGL state machine. Data like the color of the vertex, texture and fog. We will cover all of this later, so no need to worry about it right now. The important thing to understand is that none of these things matter without a vertex to use them!\n"},"Chapter3/Points.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Points.html","title":"Points","body":"Drawing a Point with OpenGL\nRendering a point\nIt doesn&#39;t get any more primitive then a point, so that&#39;s what we should look at first. Drawing a point on screen is actually a really powerful tool, if you can draw a single pixel on screen you can draw anything! With that said, you can draw a point on screen by putting this code in your render function: \nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Points);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.End();\nRun this code (Seriously, when i say run this code i mean type it in and try it for yourself) and you will see a tiny white pixel in the middle of your screen.\nThe first line tells OpenGL that we are about to draw points, by passing the Points primitive type to GL.Begin. The next line tells OpenGL to draw a point at the origin (0, 0, 0). The last line tells OpenGL that we are done drawing.\nNote, the indentation on the second line is optional. I indent my code that sits betwel Begin / End calls to make it easyer to read.\nWhat if you want to draw a second point at (0, 1 0)? Well you could type out:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Points);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.End();\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Points);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.End();\nHowever this is very inefficient! Every time you see a Begin / End block that is 1 draw call. The above code uses two draw calls to render two points.\nA draw call is when the CPU has to upload data to the GPU. It is an expensive operation, you should aim to have as few draw calls as possible.\nTake note that the primitive type passed to Begin is Points, plural. This suggests that between a single begin / end call you can render multiple points, and that is exactly the case.\nIn the real world, you would render two points like so:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Points);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.End();\nModifying Point Size\nOpenGL gives you a great deal of control when rendering trough it&#39;s state machine. There are many aspects of a single point you can change. Let&#39;s take a look at size. To modify the size of a point you use\nvoid GL.PointSize(float size);\nThis results in a square whose width and height are both represented by the size argument. The default size is 1.0 If point antialiasing is disabled (which it is by default) the point size will be rounded to the nearest integer (with a minimum of 1). \nIf you want to get the current point size, you can do so with GL.GetFloat by passing GetPName.PointSize as it&#39;s argument.\nHere is an example of how this could be used:\nfloat oldSize = GL.GetFloat(GetPName.PointSize);\n// if a point was small, make it big. Otherwise make it 1!\nif (oldSize &lt; 1.0f) {\n    GL.PointSize(5.0f);\n}\nelse {\n    GL.PointSize(1.0f);\n}\nAntialiasing points\nAltough you can specify primitives with almost infinite precision, there are a finite number of pixels on screen. This causes the edges of those primitives to look jagged. Anti-Aliasing is a method to smooth those edges, giving the polygon a more natural look.\nYou can enable anti-aliasing by passing EnableCap.PointSmooth to GL.Enable. You can disable it by passing the same paramater to GL.Disable. If you are unsure if point smoothing is currently enabled in the state machine, use GL.IsEnabled with the same argument.\n// If anti-aliasing is disabled, enable it\nif (!GL.IsEnabled(EnableCap.PointSmooth)) {\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.PointSmooth);\n}\nWhen anti-aliasing is enabled, not all pixel sizes may benefit. The specs say only a point size of 1.0 is guaranteed to get anti-aliased. Other sizes depend on your graphics card and OpenGL driver.\nWhen anti aliasing is on, the current point size is used as the diameter of a circle, centered around the vertex.\nEffect of distance\nNormally points always occupy the same amount of space onscreen, regardless of how far away they are from the viewer. For some applications (particles, stars) points need to be larger if they are closer, and smaller if they are farther. You can do this with the GL.PointParamater function. The signature looks like this\nvoid GL.PointParameter(PointParameterName param, int value);\nvoid GL.PointParameter(PointParameterName param, int[] value);\nvoid GL.PointParameter(PointParameterName param, float value);\nvoid GL.PointParameter(PointParameterName param, float[] value);\nThe following are valid arguments:\n\nPointSizeMin Sets the lower bounds OpenGL will scale a point to, second argument is a float.\nPointSizeMax Sets the upper bounds OpenGL will scale a point to, second argument is a float.\nPointDistanceAttenuation Taes an Array of 3 floats that corespond to a, b, c of the attenuation algorithm 1 / (a + b * d + c * (d * d))\nPointFadeThreshold Takes a single float, points smaller than this will start to fade out\n\nExample\nFollow along with this example, see what the results look like on your screen when you add this code to your render block:\nfloat pointSize = 0.5f;\nfor (float pointPosition = -1.0f; pointPosition &lt; 1.0f; pointPosition += 0.25f) {\n    GL.PointSize(pointSize);\n\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Points);\n        GL.Vertex3(pointPosition, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.End();\n\n    pointSize += 1.0f;\n}\nSpace\nThis is very important\nTake note of where the points on screen are rendered. In the middle. This is because we start X at -1.\nIn OpenGL, Point(0, 0) is the middle of the screen. The left size is X: -1 the right side is X: 1. Similarly the top is Y: 1 and the bottom is Y: -1. Z also ranges from -1 to 1. \nAnother way to think about this, OpenGL draws inside of a cube. The far left corner of the cube is at (-1, -1, -1), the far right corner is at (1, 1, 1). These coordinates are called Normalized Device Coordinates or NDC for short.\n"},"Chapter3/Lines.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Lines.html","title":"Lines","body":"Drawing lines in 3D\nA line is just a connection between two points. As such, rendering a line is not too different from rendering two points. And because you already know how to do that, lets dive right in:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n    GL.Vertex3(-2.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(2.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.End();\nThis time you start off by passing Lines as the primitive type to Begin / End so that OpenGL knows that for every two vertices it needs to draw one line.\nJust like with points, you can draw multiple lines within the Begin / End calls. If you wanted to render wo lines, you would need to supply four vertices.\nAs with points, OpenGL allows you to change several parameters of the state machine that affect how your line is drawn. In addition to setting the line width and setting anti-aliasing you can also specify a stipple pattern.\nLine Width\nThe default line width is 1.0. To find out the currently selected line with pass GetPName.LineWidth to GL.GetFloat. To change the line width, call the GL.LineWidth function:\nvoid GL.LineWidth(float);\nAnti aliasing lines\nAnti Aliasing points works almost the same as it does for lines. You can toggle it by passing EnableCap.LineSmooth to GL.Enable and GL.Disable. You can check if it&#39;s turned on by passing the same enum value to GL.IsEnabled\nAgain, as with points, when using anti-aliasing OpenGL implementations are only required to support it for line widths of 1.0f.\nStipple pattern\nYou can specify a stipple pattern with which to draw lines. The stipple pattern specifies a mask that will determine which portions of the line get drawn, therefore it can be used to create dahsed lines. Before specifying a pattern, you must enable stipple-ing with EnableCaps.LineStipple. The you set the stipple with the following function:\nvoid GL.Stipple(int factor, short pattern);\nThe factor paramater defaults to 1. It is capped to be between 1 and 256. It&#39;s used to specify how many times each bit in the pattern is repeated before moving on to the next bit. \nThe pattern paramater is used to specify a 16-bit pattern. Any bits that are set will result in the coresponding pixels getting drawn. If a bit is not set, it&#39;s pixel is not drawn. Something to be aware of, these bits are applied in reverse, so the low-order bit effects the left most pixel.\nHere is an example of a bitmask, and how it corelates to rendering:\n\nThe following code enables linte stippling and then specifies a pattern of alternating dashes and dots:\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.LineStipple);\nshort pattern = Convert.ToInt16(&quot;FAFA&quot;, 16);\n// Convert.ToInt16 converts a hex string into a short. \n// We are using the below hex:\n// 0xFAFA OR 1111 1010 1111 1010\n\n// Draw the pattern as 0101 1111 0101 1111\n// because remember, it&#39;s reversed, low bit first.\nGL.LineStipple(2, pattern);\nYou can determine the currently selected stipple pattern with:\nint factor = GL.GetInteger(LineStippleRepeat);\nshort pattern =  (short)GL.GetInteger(GetPName.LineStipplePattern)\nExample\nFollow along with this example\n// Draw a series of lines that increase in width\nfloat lineWidth = 0.5f;\nfor (float lineY = 1.0f; lineY &gt; -1.0f; lineY -= 0.25f) {\n    GL.LineWidth(lineWidth);\n\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.9f,  lineY, 0.0f);\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.1f,  lineY, 0.0f);\n    GL.End();\n\n    lineWidth += 1.0f;\n}\n\n// Deaw a series of lines with stippline\nlineWidth = 0.5f;\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.LineStipple);\nshort pattern = Convert.ToInt16(&quot;AAAA&quot;, 16);\nGL.LineStipple(2, pattern);\n\nfor (float lineY = 1.0f; lineY &gt; -1.0f; lineY -= 0.25f) {\n    GL.LineWidth(lineWidth);\n\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.1f, lineY, 0.0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.9f, lineY, 0.0f);\n    GL.End();\n\n    lineWidth += 1.0f;\n}\n\n// Try taking this out, see what happens!\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.LineStipple);\nIn the end, what happens if you take out that GL.Disable? The short of it is, nothing automatically resets the OpenGL state machine at the end of the frame. If you enable something, it will stay enabled (across frames &amp; draw calls) until YOU disbale it!\nThe bolded sentance above is very important. More often than not when you have a bug it&#39;s because you set the state machine into some state, and didn&#39;t set it back to default afterwards\n"},"Chapter3/Polygons.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Polygons.html","title":"Polygons","body":"Drawing polygons in 3D\nAltough you can (and will) do some interesting things with points and lines, polygons will give you the most power to create immersive 3D worlds. With that being said, the rest of Chapter 3 will be spend discussing polygons. Before we get into the specific polygon types supported by OpenGL (Triangles, Quadralatirals, Generic Poligons) we need to discuss a few things that pretain to all polygon types.\nYou draw all polygons by specifying several points in 3D space. These points specify a region that is then filled with color. At least, thats the default behaviour. However as you probably expect by now, the state machine controls the way in which a polygon is drawn. Trough the state machine you can change the drawing behaviour. Use the following function to change the way polygons are drawn:\nvoid GL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace, PolygonMode);\nOpenGL handles the front and back faces of polygons seperateley. A front face is any face of a polygon that is facing the camera. A back face is any face of a polygon that is facing away from the camera. \nAs a result, when you call GL.PolygonMode you need to change the face to which the change will apply. You do this by passing either MaterialFace.Front, MaterialFace.Back or MaterialFace.FrontAndBack as the first paramater.\nThe following values are valid for the second paramater:\n\nPolygonMode.Point Each vertex is rendered as a single point. This basicaly produces the same effect as calling GL.Begin with Lines as the argument.\nPolygonMode.Line This will draw the edges of the polygon as a set of lines. This is similar to calling GL.Begin with LineLoop\nPolygonMode.Fill This is the default state, which renders the polygon with the interior filled.  This is the only state in which polygon smoothing takes effect.\n\nIf you want to see the back facing polygons of a model, you could render the front facing polygons as lines, and the back facing polygons solid. You can achieve this like so:\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.Front, PolygonMode.Line);\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.Back, PolygonMode.Fill);\nIf you have not changed the polygon mode for back facing poly&#39;s, the second line is redundant. This is because the default fill mode is Fill. But better safe than sorry.\nOn your own\nTry to draw 5 squares (NOT CUBES) on screen. To draw a square, call GL.Begin with PrimitiveType.Polygon as it&#39;s argument. The put 4 vertices down. \nRemember, the view goes from -1 to +1. Your vertices all have to be within that range. Keep their Z coordinates at 0.\nOnce all 5 are rendering, set the following polygon modes (each square will have a different mode)\n\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.Front, PolygonMode.Line);\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.Back, PolygonMode.Point);\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, PolygonMode.Fill);\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.Back, PolygonMode.Line);\nGL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, PolygonMode.Line);\n\nSee how the rendering changed.\nFace Culling\nAltough polygons are infinetley thin they still have two sides. They can be seen from either side. Sometimes, it makes sense to have each side displayed differently, and this is why some of the function presented require you to specify whether you&#39;re modifying the front face, back face or both. The takeaway is that rendering states for both sides of a polygon are stored seperateley.\nMost often the player will only be able to see one side of a polygon. It is possible to tell OpenGL to not render polygons that the player can&#39;t see! For example, if you are looking at a ball, only half of the polygons are visible. This is where front and back facing polygons get interesting. If your geometry has no holes in it, that is if your geometry is a solid hull (as most objects in the real world are then back facing polygons will not be seen.\nSo, why waste time and CPU power transforming and shading them? Well, the answer is dont.  OpenGL can automatically not render faces for you trough a process called culling. To use polygon culling, you must first enable it by calling:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\nThen you need to specify which faces you want culled, front or back, by calling:\nvoid GL.CullFace(CullFaceMode);\nCullFaceMode can be CullFaceMode.Front, CullFaceMode.Back or CullFaceMode.FrontAndBack. Calling CullFaceMode.FrontAndBack will cause polygons to not render at all, this isn&#39;t particularly useful. The default value is Back.\nAfter you&#39;ve set your cullface you have to tell openGL what your Polygon Winding is. What is winding? Winding is the order in which you define the vertices of your polygons. Yes, the order you define them in matters!\nTake this image for example:\n\nFor simplicity, lets assume we have three vertices whos X Y and Z coordinates are all 0 1 and to respectivley. These are the vertices:\n(0, 0, 0)\n(1, 1, 1)\n(2, 2, 2)\nTo render them clockwise (CW):\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Polygon);\n    GL.Vertex3(0,0,0);\n    GL.Vertex3(1,1,1);\n    GL.Vertex3(2,2,2);\nGL.End();\nTo render them counter-clockwise (CCW):\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Polygon);\n    GL.Vertex3(0,0,0);\n    GL.Vertex3(2,2,2);\n    GL.Vertex3(1,1,1);\nGL.End();\nWinding directly affects polygon facing! If a polygon is front facing when wound CW, it will be back facing when wound CCW. OpenGL uses winding information to determine which polygons are front facing and which polygons are back facing.\nBy default OpenGL treats polygons with counter-clockwise (CCW) ordering as front-facing polygons. This can be changed with the following function:\nvoid GL.FrontFace(FrontFaceDirection);\nTry it! Define a polygon with 3 points in a counter-clockwise fashion. Enable culling. This will produce a triangle. Run your program and it will show up on screen. Now add this line of code before running your program:\nGL.FrontFace(FrontFaceDirection.Cw);\nAnd the triangle disapears! This is because you now set front facing polygons to be CW, and back facing ones to be CCW, the opposite of the default behaviour.\nBy default culling is disabled. In games this is a bad thing as rendering gets expensive. One of the first things most games do in Initialize is to enable culling and set it to cull out back faces. While the default CCW front face is great, we often also explicitly set it to CCW so that future programmers know how the system works by reading the code.\nAnti-Aliasing polygons\nAs with points and lines you can choose to anti-alias polygons. You control polygon antialiasing by passing EnableCap.PolygonSmooth to GL.Enable or GL.Disable. You can check if anti aliasing is enabled by passing EnableCap.PolygonSmooth to GL.IsEnabled. As you might expect it is disabled by default. Here is an example of how to enable it:\nif (!GL.Isenabled(EnableCap.PolygonSmooth)) {\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.PolygonSmooth);\n}\nOn Your Own\nOn your own try to:\n\nDisable polygon anti-aliasing\nDraw a triangle on the left side of the screen\nEnable polygon anti-aliasing\nDraw a triangle on the right side of the screen\n\nSend me a screenshot of the resulting window on skype (don&#39;t upload it anywhere, i don&#39;t want compression artifacts in this). I want to see what the difference looks like on your computer. \n"},"Chapter3/Triangles.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Triangles.html","title":"Triangles","body":"Triangles\nTriangles are generally the preffered polygon to be used in video games. There are several reasons for this:\n\nTriangles are always coplanar.\nBecause 3 points define a plane\n\n\nA triangle is always convex\nThat means it does not fold in on its-self \nLook up what a convex &amp; concave polygon looks like if this confuses you\n\n\nA triangle will never cross over its-self\nA triangle will never have a hole in it\n\nIf you try to render a polygon that violates any of the above bullet points, the results will be unpredictable. Because any polygon can be broken down into a set of triangles (a process called triangulation), and rendering triangles is guaranteed to not have undefined behaviour, everything renderd in a video game is a triangle.\n\nMost 3D artists prefer to model with quads. Because of this every 3D modelling program has an option to triangulate models and export only triangles. I wasn&#39;t kidding, every 3D model that gets rendered on screen is broken down into triangles!\nDrawing a 3D triangle isn&#39;t much more difficult than drawing a point, or a line. You just need to pass PrimitiveType.Triangles to GL.Begin and provide 3 vertices. Every 3 vertices will make one triangle!\n// Draw a full screen triangle\nGl.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n    GL.Vertex3(-1, -1, 0);\n    GL.Vertex3(1, -1, 0);\n    GL.Vertex3(0, 1, 0);\nGL.End();\nJust like with points and lines, you can draw multiple triangles at one time. OpenGL treats every vertex tripple as a seperate triangle. If the number of vertices isn&#39;t a multiple of 3, the extra vertices are discarded.\nDegenerates\nA triangle with an area of 0 is essentially a point or a line, for example:\n(1, 0, 0)\n(1, 0, 0)\n(0, 1, 0)\nThe above tirangle is a line, it has no height! This WILL NOT RENDER as a line. Degenerate triangles are rejected and never rendered. (This behaviour is often exploited when rendering large terrains or mountains)\nTriangle Variations\nOpenGL also supports a couple of primitives related to triangles that might save you some keystrokes. In the olden days they used to save performance too, but on modern cards (Graphics cards created after 2003) there is no performance difference.\nLets assume you use two triangles to render a distorted quad:\n\nHere you have two connected triangles with vertices A and C in common. If you render them with PrimitiveType.Triangles you will need to define a total of 6 vertices. This means you will send vertices A and C trough the rendering pipeline twice! \nOne way to aoid this is to use a triangle strip. When calling GL.Begin pass PrimitiveType.TriangleStrip for it&#39;s argument. OpenGL will draw the first 3 vertices as a triangle, after that it will take every vertex specified and combine it with the previous two vertices to form another triangle. This means that after the first triangle, every additional triangle will only need one vertex for it&#39;s data.\nHere is a visual example of a triangle strip:\n\nAnother variation on triangles is the triangle fan. You can visualize them as a series of triangles around a central vertex. You draw fans by passing PrimitiveType.TriangleFan to GL.Begin. The first vertex specified is the center vertex. Every following two vertices make a triangle with the center vertex. Here is what that looks like:\n\nFans don&#39;t offer as much savins as strips, but they still offer some savings.\nA history lesson\nFrom about 2000 to 2006 triangle strips provided a LOT of savings in BOTH memory and performance. We simply didn&#39;t have enough ram and horsepower on the GPU to support large models made up of too many triangles.\nMany programmers capitalized on this, and wrote software that would take a triangulated model and create a model of triangle strips from it. These software where collectivley called strippers, because they made strips.\nAs you can imagine strippers where not very efficient with large complex models. As graphics cards grew more powerful, these software became more and more outdated.\nOn a fairly new graphcis card (2006+) it is faster to draw a million regular triangles than it is to draw the same number of triangles using a strip. This is because graphics cards manufacturers caught on that rendering triangles fast is important, so they built special circuitry to handle the situation.\nAnd just like that modern games grew up. We have stopped stripping and are instead just rendering large sets of triangles.\n"},"Chapter3/Quads.html":{"url":"Chapter3/Quads.html","title":"Quadrilaterals and Polygons","body":"Quadrilaterals\nQuadrilaterals, or quads, are four-sided polygons that can be convenient when you want to draw a square or a rectangle. You create them by passing PrimitiveType.Quads to GL.Begin, then supplying 4 vertices. Like triangles you can draw mulyiple quads within the same GL.Begin/GL.End block.\nOpenGL provides Quad strips as a means of improving the rendering of multiple larger quads, but you will use this feature less than you will use triangle strips. They are kind of useless.\nWhen rendering a quad strip, the first 4 vertices specify the first quad, after that every two vertices will be used with the previous two vertices to create new quads.\nThis is the order you should define a quad in:\n\nPolygons\nAs discussed earlyer OpenGL also supports rendering polygons with an arbitrary number of sides. In such cases, onyl one polygon can be drawn inside a GL.Beign / GL.End block. To render a polygon pass PrimitiveType.Polygon (Note, it&#39;s singular) to GL.Begin.  Once GL.End is reached, the last vertex is connected to the first. If less than 3 vertices are provided, the polygon is considered degenerate and nothing will render. Here is an example of what an arbitrary polygon can look like:\n\nSample\nLets put everything we&#39;ve learned into one tidy little sample.

Now lets take a look at how to save and restore the values of a set of related state variables with a single command.\nAn attribute group is a set of related state variables that OpenGL classifies into a group. For example, the line group consists of all the line drawing attributes, such as width, stipple pattern and anti-aliasing. The polygon group consists of the same set of attributes, just for polygons. You can save and restore these values by using the GL.PushAttrib and GL.PopAttrib functions. These are the signatures\nvoid GL.PushAttrib(AttribMask);\nvoid GL.PopAttrib();\nPushAttrib saves all of the attributes for an attribute group specified by it&#39;s argument (an AttribMask enum). To be more specific, it pushes all the attributes onto a stack known as the attribute stack. PopAttrib restores the previous attributes by poping the top of the attribute stack. \nThe argument to PushAttrib is a bit-msak. The arguments you pass in can be combined with a bitwise OR ( | )The following AttribMask values are valid:\n\nAllAttribBits All opengl state variables in all attribute groups\nEnableBit Enable state variables\nFogBit Fog state variables\nLightingBit Lighting state variables\nLineBit Line state variables\nPointBit Point state variables\nPolygonBit Polygon state variables\nTextureBit Texturing state variables\n\nIt&#39;s common to set a default state for everything in your initialize function.

For example, something like this\nvoid RenderModel() {\n    // Push bits as we might go into wireframe mode, or into untextured mode. \n    // We don&#39;t know for sure, it&#39;s configured with a variable.\n    // Some models might be wireframe, others might not!\n    GL.PushAttrib(AttribMask.PolygonBit | AttribMask.TextureBit);\n\n    if (renderWireframe) {\n        GL.PolygonMode(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, PolygonMode.Line);\n    }\n\n    // This function might change texturing paramaters!\n    DoTexturing();\n\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n    foreach(Traignle t in triangles) {\n        GL.Vertex3(t.v1.x, t.v1.y, t.v1.z);\n        GL.Vertex3(t.v2.x, t.v2.y, t.v2.z);\n        GL.Vertex3(t.v3.x, t.v3.y, t.v3.z);\n    }\n    GL.End();\n\n    // Restore polygon and texture render modes to default!\n    GL.PopAttrib();\n}\n"},"Chapter4/Introduction.html":{"url":"Chapter4/Introduction.html","title":"Transformations And Matrices","body":"Transformations And Matrices\nNow it&#39;s time to take a short break from learning how to create 3D Objects in the world and focus on learning hot to move the objects around in the world. This is vital to generating realistic 3D worlds!

Like all 3D graphics systems, OpenGL uses linear algebra; it treats vertices as vectors and transforms them by using vector-matrix multiplication. The transformation process is called a pipeline because geometry passes trough several coordinate systems on the way to window space. Each coordinate system serves a purpose for one or more OpenGL features.\nFor each stage of the transformation pipeline, this section describes the characteristics of that coordinate system, what OpenGL operations are performed there, and how to construct and control transformations to the next coordinate system in the pipeline.\nIt&#39;s important to understand that when we render an object, we don&#39;t move it. We put a vertex trough a transformation pipeline, and a new, transformed vertex comes out. We render this transformed vertex, then throw it away. The original vertices of the models will never be changed.\n When rendering 3D scenes, vertices pass trough 4 types of transformations before they are rendered onto the screen:\n\nModeling Transform The modeling transformation moves objects around the scene and moves objects from local coordinates into world coordinates\nViewing Tranasform The viewing transformation specifies the location of the camera and moves objects from world coordinates into eye coordinates (camera coordinates)\nProjection Transform The projection transformation defines the viewing volume and clipping planes, it maps objects from eye coordinates to clip coordinates (-1 to +1 on all axis, clip coordinates are also called NDC)\nViewport transform The viewport transformation maps the clip coordinates (NDC) into the two-dimensional view port (the window on your screen)\n\nA summary of the transformation pipeline:\n\nWhile these four transformations are standard in 3D graphics, OpenGL combines the model and view transforms into a single modelview transformation. The viewport transform (also known as w divide) is done automatrically by OpenGL.\nIf yo look at the above diagram, there are only two matrices in the pipeline. These are the matrices that the state machine let&#39;s you specify, the ModelView matrix and the Projection matrix.\nA closer look at the pipeline\n\nThis is the entire pipeline in a bit easyer to follow fashion. Let&#39;s take a closer look at what each section foes.\nObject Coordinates\nApplications specify vertices in object coordinates. The definition of object coordinates is entireley up to the application. Some applications render scenes that are composed of many models, each created and specified in it&#39;s own individual coordinate system.\nWhat this means is that each model is centered around it&#39;s own origin. When you export a 3D model from blender, that model was created around (0, 0, 0) and is said to be in model space.\nWhen you load in an object, it is in Object space. It will be in the middle of your scene.\nThe Model Transformation\nThe model transformation transforms geometry from object to world coordinates. Applications store both the model and view transforms in a single matrix called the modelView matrix.\nOnce you apply the model transform, the object is now in world space. That is, X, Y, Z is (potentially) no longer located at the origin of the world.\nThe modeling transformation allows you to position and orient a model by moving, rotating and scaling it You can perform these operations one at a time or as a combination of events. \n\nThe order in which you specify modeling transformations is very important to the final rendering of your scene. (remember, order of matrix multiplication matters)\n\nRotating an object first, then translating it will give a very different result than translating an object and then rotating it. So, what&#39;s the proper order to transform your primitives? Well that depends on the result you want to get. But in general, multiplication order is accepted as:\n\nFirst Scale\nSecond Rotate\nLastly Translate\n\nWorld Coordinates\nThe world-coordinate system is an application construct that exists between the object and eye coordinate systems.  If we split the ModelView matrix into two matrices, multiplying object space coordinates by the Model matrix would get them to world space.\nThe reason that the Model and View matrices have been collapsed into a single matrix is because OpenGL has no internal concept of &quot;World Space&quot;. There are no rendering calculations to be done in world space, so the state machine has no idea what that actually is.\nThe View Transform\nIn precise terms, the view  transform is the inverse transformation of the cameras world space coordinates.\nThis may sound a bit odd. Everything goes trough the render pipeline, even the camera. So, what happens when you multiply the cameras world coordinates by the view matrix (The inverse of the cameras world coordinates)? You get an identity matrix!\nThis means that the camera will be positioned at the origin of the world, looking down the negative Z axis. Every object will be transformed relative to this orientation. Do you know what this implies?\nThis implies that when we render a 3D world, as far as the graphics pipeline is concerned the camera does not move. It stays stationary at origin, instead the world moves around the camera!\nEye Coordinates\nOpenGL eye coordinates are defined as follows:\n\nThe viewpoint is at the origin\nThe view direction is down the negative Z axis\nPositive Y is up\nPositive X is to the right\n\nFor geometry to be visible in a standard perspecive projection it must lie somewhere along the negative Z axis. \nWhen you multiply an object bythe ModelView matrix it ends up in eye coordinates, which meets all 4 of the above requirements. This is why we don&#39;t move the camera, rather the world around the camera.\nThink of eye coordinates as &quot;what the camera sees&quot;. This is what the eye coordinate space looks like, it is the camera multiplied by the view matrix.\n\nThe Projection Transformation\nOpenGL multiplies eye coordinates by the projection matrix to produce clip coordinates. The projection matrix defines the size and shape of the view volume, and therefore determines the portion of eye coordinates that will be visible or invisible. \nTypically applications create a perspecive projection or a parallel projection. The proper name a parallel projection is orthographic projection\nHere is an example of looking at two objects from the exact same position with the exact same orientation. The only difference is one is looking with perspective, the other is looking orthographic:\n\nThis is how the respective cameras see the world:\n\nClip Coordinates\nOpenGL clips primitives that lie outside the view volume in clip coordinate space. A clip coordinate vertex is within the viw volume if it&#39;s x, y and z values are all within the  -w to w space.\nWow that makes no sense! Don&#39;t worry, this is one of those things OpenGL does automatically for you! You will never have to concern yourself with the implementation of this step. \nYou will configure clip coordinates using the GL.Ortho and GL.Frustum methods.\nBasically, OpenGL ignores any geometry outside the view volume, (se the green sphere in the above picture)\nPerspective Division\nOpenGL divides clip coordinate (x, y and z) values by the clip-coordinate w value to produce noramlized device coordinates (NDC). As with clipping, OpenGL will do this automatically for you (provided you have a projection matrix in place). If you have an orthographics projection matrix, nothing really happens here.\nFor perspective projections, the perspective division step effectivley shrinks distant geometry and expands near geometry.\nRemember, NDC space goes from -1 to +1 on all axis.\nNormalized Device Coordinates\nIn normalized device coordinate space all vertex values lie withing the -1 to +1 range. In previous coordinate systems, they could have been anywhere!\nOpenGL performs no calulations in NDC space, it&#39;s simply a coordinate system that exists between the perspective division and the viewport transformation to window coordinates.\nThe Viewport Transform\nThe viewport transformation is the final stage of the transformation pipeline. It&#39;s a scale and translation that maps the -1 to +1 NDC cube into X / Y window coordinates. Technically this stage also modifies the Z value to be within an acceptable range of the Z-Buffer, which we will talk about later.\nAgain, this happens automatically, you have some control using the GL.Viewport function, which we will discuss later.\nWindow Coordinates\nWindow coordinates have their x, y origin in the bottom-left corner of the window. Window z values extend the Z-Buffer.\nProgrammers often make the mistake of assuming that window coordinates are integers (because hey, a window is rendered as pixels). This is not the case. OpenGL window coordinates are actualy floating point values, vertices can exist in sub-pixel locations. This is essential for correct rastirezation and effective anti-aliasing.\nThis is the part of the pipeline where a picture is finally rendered to your window, we are now done with the pipeline.\n"},"Chapter4/DeepDive.html":{"url":"Chapter4/DeepDive.html","title":"Transformation Deep Dive","body":"Transformation Pipeline Deep Dive\nThe problem with most books is that they glaze over the transformation pipeline. This is bad! The Transformation Pipeline is the heart of 3D rendering!

Bookmark it, read it and take it to heart; print it if you have to. If you are still confused at the end of this chapter, reread that article and talk to me!\nMore Visualization\nTo kind of sum up what the above article is saying, this is what&#39;s going on:\n\nImage was taken from this article, you don&#39;t have to read it, but it&#39;s there if you are curious\n\nLocal coordinates are the coordinates of your object relative to its local origin; they&#39;re the coordinates your object begins in.\nThe next step is to transform the local coordinates to world-space coordinates which are coordinates in respect of a larger world. These coordinates are relative to a global origin of the world, together with many other objects also placed relative to the world&#39;s origin.\nNext we transform the world coordinates to view-space coordinates in such a way that each coordinate is as seen from the camera or viewer&#39;s point of view.\nAfter the coordinates are in view space we want to project them to clip coordinates. Clip coordinates are processed to the -1.0 and 1.0 range and determine which vertices will end up on the screen.\nAnd lastly we transform the clip coordinates to screen coordinates in a process we call viewport transform that transforms the coordinates from -1.0 and 1.0 to the coordinate range defined by glViewport. The resulting coordinates are then sent to the rasterizer to turn them into fragments.\n\nWhat moves\nThe view matrix is interesting, it basically frames the world. The view matrix is what the camera sees. So, what is the view matrix? It&#39;s the INVERSE (this is why inverting matrices is so important!) of the cameras world position.\nIf you remember, multiplying anything by it&#39;s inverse will result in the identity vector. Which means, if we multiply the camera world position by the view matrix it puts the cameras world position at (0, 0, 0) or origin.\nThe model-view matrix is simply combining an objects world transform with the view matrix. Effectivley moving the object into a space where the camera is at origin looking down the z axis.\nThat&#39;s right, when you move trough a 3D world, as far as rendering is concerned the camera is not moving trough the world, the world is moving around the camera.\n"},"Chapter4/OpenGLMatrices.html":{"url":"Chapter4/OpenGLMatrices.html","title":"OpenGL and Matrices","body":"OpenGL and Matrices\nNow that you&#39;ve learned about the verious transformation involved in OpenGL, lets take a look at how you actually use them.

This should be the contents of that function:\n// Draw grid\n// Set render color to gray\nGL.Color3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);\n// Draw a 40x40 grid at 0.5 intervals\n// The grid will go from -10 to +10\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n// Draw horizontal lines\nfor (int x = 0; x &lt; 40; ++x) {\n    float xPos = (float)x * 0.5f - 10.0f;\n    GL.Vertex3(xPos, 0, -10);\n    GL.Vertex3(xPos, 0,  10);\n}\n// Draw vertical lines\nfor (int z = 0; z &lt; 40; ++z) {\n    float zPos = (float)z * 0.5f - 10.0f;\n    GL.Vertex3(-10, 0, zPos);\n    GL.Vertex3( 10, 0, zPos);\n}\nGL.End();\n\n// Draw basis vectors\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n// Set the color to R &amp; draw X axis\nGL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.Vertex3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n// Set the color to G &amp; draw the Y axis\nGL.Color3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n// Set the color to B &amp; draw the Z axis\nGL.Color3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\nGL.End();\n\nKeep in mind, right now we&#39;re strictly looking at the center of NDC space. The above code will not look too impressive. Running your application, your screen should look like this:\n\nOnce we are able to position the camera and add perspective you will see that what we did really looks like this:\n\n"},"Chapter4/ModelView.html":{"url":"Chapter4/ModelView.html","title":"ModelView","body":"The ModelView Matrix\nThe modelView matrix defines the coordinate system that is used to place and orient objects.\nThis 4x4 matrix can either transform vertices, or it can be transformed its-self by other matrices. \nBefore you can do anything, you must specify if you are going to be working with the modelView or projection matrix. You can do this with the GL.MatrixMode function. This is the signature:\nvoid GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode);\nThe MatrixMode enum has two values we use, but the enum its-self has 5 values\n\nMatrixMode.Modelview\nMatrixMode.Projection\nMatrixMode.Color - we don&#39;t use this\nMatrixMode.Texture - we don&#39;t use this\nMatrixMode.Modelview0Ext\n\nUsually (99% of the time) you want to set your modelView matrix to identity. So that you start around origin. you can achieve this by calling the GL.LoadIdentity function. This function loads the identity matrix into the OpenGL state machines active matrix. (You specified the active matrix with GL.MatrixMode)\nThis snippet resets the modelview matrix:\nGL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\nGL.LoadIdentity(); // Reset modelview matrix\n// Do other transformation\nMultiplying OpenGL matrices\nWe&#39;re about to talk about 3 functions:\n\nGL.Translate\nGL.Rotate\nGL.Scale\n\nBefore we discuss how these functions work, i want you to be aware of what they actually do. When you call GL.MatrixMode with MatrixMode.Modelview as an argument, you select the modelView matrix of the OpenGL state machine as the active matrix.\nOnce you have a matrix set as the active matrix, all further matrix operations will be performed to that matrix. GL.LoadIdentity is one such operation. It takes the current matrix and sets it to identity.\nThe three functions above will generate an appropriate matrix and multiply the current matrix! GL.Rotate for instance will make a rotation matrix and multiply the current matrix by it.\nThe following OpenGL snippet\n// Set the currently active matrix\nGL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n\n// Reset modelview matrix\nGL.LoadIdentity();\n\n// Create a rotation matrix\n// then multiply the active matrix by it\nGL.Rotate(90.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\nIs the equivalent of:\nvoid Render(ref Matrix4 modelView, ref Matrix4 projection) {\n    // Set the currently active matrix\n    Matrix4 currentMatrix = modelView;\n\n    // Reset modelview matrix\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 4; ++j) {\n            currentMatrix[i, j] = (i == j)? 1.0f : 0.0f;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Create a rotation matrix\n    Matrix4 rotation = Matrix4.AngleAxis(90.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\n\n    // then multiply the active matrix by it\n    currentMatrix = rotation * currentMatrix;\n}\nOpenGL just wraps all the math up for you.

The code for it will look familiar, that is because GL.Rotate creates a rotation matrix from an angle and an axis. Just like the Matrix4.AngleAxis function you wrote. It is defined as\nvoid GL.Rotate(float angle, float xAxis, float yAxis, float zAxis);\nThe function rotates around the axis specified by xAxis, yAxis and zAxis. It rotates by angle degrees. The axis must be normalized. The function takes euler angles! The rotation is counter-clockwise!\nFor example, if you wanted to rotate by 90 degrees on the X axis, the call would be:\nGL.Rotate(90.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nIf you want to rotate clock-wise pass in a negative angle.\nLet&#39;s say you want to rotate 45 degrees on the X axis and 7 degrees on the Y axis. Figuring out the arbitrary axis to rotate around and the new rotation angle would require a LOT of math. Luckily matrix multiplication is assosiative, so we can take advantage of that!\n// First, rotate 45 degrees on X axis\nGL.Rotate(45, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n// Then, rotate 7 degrees on Y axis\nGL.Rotate(7.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nOn your own\nJust like i provided a new class for the translate sample, make a new class for the rotate sample.\nTry to rotate your world by 90 degrees on the X axis and then 180 degrees on the Z axis.

To shrink an object, use numbers smaller than 1 but greater than 0 (decimals). Using negative numbers will flip the object on the specific axis.\nGo ahead and make a sample like we did with Translation and rotation.

Sometimes also called the model matrix, or model to world matrix. But we&#39;re editing the mode-view matrix! So what is the view matrix?\nAs discussed earlyer, the view matrix is the inverse of the cameras world position! There are two things you need to know about your camera in world space, where it is (it&#39;s position) and which what it&#39;s looking (it&#39;s orientation).\nSetting the view matrix with the fixed function pipeline is challenging at best, this is mainly because there is no fixed function equivalent of interting a matrix! \nThis means if your camera is located at (90, 20, 30) and rotated to (7, 1, 0, 0) you would have to do the following commands:\n// Negate the translation of the camera\nGL.Translate(-90, -20, -30);\n// Negate the rotation of the camera\nGL.Rotate(-7, 1, 0, 0);\nWell, that wasn&#39;t so bad... Was it? No, but your world position for the camera is NEVER going to be that simple. But there is an easy way to create the world matrix of the camera, we just won&#39;t cover it until later (we cover it in the custom matrices section).\nUntil then, copy/paste and use this function. It is defined as follows:\nvoid LookAt(float eyeX, float eyeY, float eyeZ, float targetX, float targetY, float targetZ, float upX, float upY, float upZ);\nLookAt is actually a pretty standard OpenGL function. It&#39;s not included in the core of OpenGL, but it is so useful every programmer knows how it works!\nThe functions first three arguments are the position of the camera. So, if the camra is at (5, 3, 1) then the first 3 argumetns would be 5, 2, 1.\nThe second 3 arguments are the target that the camra is looking at. So if the camera is looking at world coordinates (0, 0, 0) then those would be the second three arguments.\nThe last three arguments are up. Which direction is up? Since the camera is in world space, and in world space positive Y is up, the last 3 arguments are almost always going to be 0, 1 0.\nExample\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class LookAtExample : Game {\n        Grid grid = null;\n\n         protected static void LookAt(float eyeX, float eyeY, float eyeZ, float targetX, float targetY, float targetZ, float upX, float upY, float upZ) {\n            float len = (float)Math.Sqrt(upX * upX + upY * upY + upZ * upZ);\n            upX /= len; upY /= len; upZ /= len;\n\n            float[] f = { targetX - eyeX, targetY - eyeY, targetZ - eyeZ };\n            len = (float)Math.Sqrt(f[0] * f[0] + f[1] * f[1] + f[2] * f[2]);\n            f[0] /= len; f[1] /= len; f[2] /= len;\n\n            float[] s = { 0f, 0f, 0f };\n            s[0] = f[1] * upZ - f[2] * upY;\n            s[1] = f[2] * upX - f[0] * upZ;\n            s[2] = f[0] * upY - f[1] * upX;\n            len = (float)Math.Sqrt(s[0] * s[0] + s[1] * s[1] + s[2] * s[2]);\n            s[0] /= len; s[1] /= len; s[2] /= len;\n\n            float[] u = { 0f, 0f, 0f };\n            u[0] = s[1] * f[2] - s[2] * f[1];\n            u[1] = s[2] * f[0] - s[0] * f[2];\n            u[2] = s[0] * f[1] - s[1] * f[0];\n            len = (float)Math.Sqrt(s[0] * u[0] + u[1] * u[1] + u[2] * u[2]);\n            u[0] /= len; u[1] /= len; u[2] /= len;\n\n            float[] result = {\n                s[0], u[0], -f[0], 0.0f,\n                s[1], u[1], -f[1], 0.0f,\n                s[2], u[2], -f[2], 0.0f,\n                0.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f, 1.0f\n            };\n\n            GL.MultMatrix(result);\n            GL.Translate(-eyeX, -eyeY, -eyeZ);\n        }\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            grid = new Grid();\n        }\n\n        public override void Update(float dTime) {\n\n        }\n        public override void Render() {\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n            GL.LoadIdentity(); // Reset modelview matrix\n            LookAt(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n\n            grid.Render();\n        }\n        public override void Shutdown() {\n\n        }\n    }\n}\nRunning the example produces this screen:\n\nCool, we can now see the grid with some perspective! Why are we so close? Well, we didn&#39;t set a projection matrix yet (we don&#39;t really know how to), so anything further than 1 will simply not render as our world projection is still in NDC. But hey, at least we can look at things with angles now!\n"},"Chapter4/Order.html":{"url":"Chapter4/Order.html","title":"Function Order","body":"Function order\nBoy, we covered a LOT in the last section! We saw how we could translate, rotate and scale an object to create the world matrix. We also saw how we can use lookAt to create a view matrix.\nNow, i always say matrix multiplication is assisiative, but not cumulative. This means:\n\nA * B * C = A * (B * C)\nA * B != B * A\n\nSo, whats the right order to multiply matrices in? Well, with the modelView matrix you would expect to multiply the model by the view matrix, but that is NOT the case. That&#39;s right, we&#39;re about to make matrices a LOT more confusing. But first, let&#39;s take a look at the full multiplication that&#39;s happening.\nRemember, OpenGL is column major, so vectors are column matrices (1 x 4). Because matrix multiplication inner products must match, this means the vector goes on the right side. The entire transform pipeline looks like this:\nIn theory\ntranslated vertex = vertex * model * view * projection\nHow OpenGL really does it\nrenderVertex = vertex * modelView * projection\nWe want to first transform into model space, then view space, then projection space. Column major matrices have a slight gotcha to them, the matrices take effect from left to right, not right to left. \nThis means that the above code, would first move into projection space, then view space then model space. The exact Opposite of what we want!\nThis is confusing, but in order to do this:\ntranslated vertex = vertex -&gt; model -&gt; view -&gt; projection\nYou have to multiply in reverse order, like so:\ntranslated vertex = projection * view * model * vertex\nThis is not the case for row major matrices! Only column major ones.\nScaling, Translating and Rotating\nThe other order we need to worry about is scale-translate-rotate order. \nWhat order should you scale/translate/rotate in?\n\nScale First\nRotate second\nTranslate last\n\nSo the transformation pipe looks like this:\ntransformed = vertex -&gt; scale -&gt; rotate -&gt; translate\nRemember, multiply right to leftThis means your multiplication order will look like this:\nResult = Translate * Rotate * Scale * Vertex\nFun times.\nOpenGL functions\nHopefully that all made sense, so how does that apply to OpenGL functions? Well if you recall, openGL functions just multiply matrices, so we have to call them in the right order, like so\nvoid Render() {\n    // Pipeline: translated vertex = vertex -&gt; model -&gt; view -&gt; projection\n    // Model matrix: transformed = vertex -&gt; scale -&gt; rotate -&gt; translate\n    // Remember, read right to left when implementing multiplication!\n\n    // TODO: Set up projection here\n    // Multiply projection\n\n    // Set the modelView matrix to identity\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.ModelView);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n\n    // Multiply view\n    LookAt(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n\n    // Draw an object\n    // Multiply model (scale, rotate, translate)\n    // Multiply translate\n    GL.Translate(-3.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\n    // Multiply rotate\n    GL.Rotate(90.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    // Multiply scale\n    GL.Scale(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); // No scale\n\n    // The actual model has the input vertices\n    DrawCube();\n}\n\nIf this doesn&#39;t make sense right now, go ahead and give me a call on skype. I know it&#39;s a bit of a confusing topic.\nBox Demo\nLet&#39;s make a demo that draws a cube in the scene. This cube will have some rotation, scale and translation for you to play around with.\nFirst, make a new demo scene and follow along\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class BoxDemo : Game {\n        Grid grid = null;\n\n        // Add Look at function, it&#39;s in this gist\n        // https://gist.github.com/gszauer/91038dbb010755d719de\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            grid = new Grid();\n        }\n\n        public override void Update(float dTime) {\n\n        }\n        public override void Render() {\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n            GL.LoadIdentity(); // Reset modelview matrix\n            LookAt(\n                0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, // Position\n                0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, // Target\n                0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f  // Up\n            );\n\n            // Render grid at the origin of the world\n            grid.Render();\n        }\n\n        public override void Shutdown() {\n\n        }\n    }\n}\nThis puts us exactly where we left off in the last section. With the grid being visible at an angle. Remember, your machine will not look 100% like mine. We should have the same image, but yours might be culled out on the side.\nNext, let&#39;s add a function that draws a cube. How do you draw a cube? A lot of triangles. I went ahead and drew one on paper, then counted all the verts out into CCW triangles. The result is this static function. \nGo ahead and add the above function to your class. In render, after drawing the grid set the render color to red, and draw the cube. Like so:\n public override void Render() {\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity(); // Reset modelview matrix\n    LookAt(\n        0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, // Position\n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, // Target\n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f  // Up\n    );\n\n    // Render grid at the origin of the world\n    grid.Render();\n\n    // Set render color\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    // Draw cube\n    DrawCube();\n}\nWhen you run the game one of two things is going to happen. Either the entire screen is going to be red, or you will see the scene as before, with no changes. This is because the size of the cube is -1 to +1. The same size as NDC. The cube will either fill NDC and render the whole screen red, or get clipped and not render at all.Depends on your graphics card&#39;s default Z-Test setting.\nOn your own\nWe now have a rudimentary 3D scene! I want you to apply the following transformation to the 3D cube on your own:\n\nScale to 0.05f on all axis\nRotate 73 degrees on the Y axis\nRotate 45 degrees on the X axis\nTranslate to 0.25f on the X axis \nTranslate to -0.25f on the Z axis\n\nKeep in mind, if your pipeline is\nscale -&gt; rotate -&gt; translate\nThen the multiplication order is \ntranslate * scale * rotate\nI&#39;ll give you a bit of a hint as to where to do this. The full transform pipeline is this:\nrender vertex = projection -&gt; model -&gt; view -&gt; scale -&gt; rotate -&gt; translate -&gt; original vertex\nWe don&#39;t have projection yet. No action there\nSo you want to set the modelview matrix with the lookAt function (this was already done in the previous step, it does not change)\nNext you want to render the grid at origin. We don&#39;t want to apply any transformations to the grid. You could say, the grid is only transformed by the view matrix, it has no model matrix.\nNext you want to do your Scaling, Rotating and Translating. This is going to be the &quot;model&quot; part of the modelView matrix. It will position the square in the scene.\nLast, you simply set the color to red (already there from previous section) and render by calling DrawCube (already there from previous section).\nThe resulting screen will look kind of like this:\n\nIf you get stuck, this page has a subsection with the solution.

What if we want to add another cube to our scene to make the game a bit more interesting? \nAfter we transform the inital cube, we have to reset the modelview matrix to how it was before we rendered the first cube, otherwise the second cube will not render relative to the world origin, but rather relative to the first cube. \nSo this is what you would have to do:\n\nSelect modelview matrix\nLoad itentity\nApply view matrix (LookAt)\nDraw grid\nApply cube 1 model matrix\nDraw cube 1\nApply inverse of cube 1 model matrix\nApply cube 2 model matrix\ndraw cube 2\n\nThis is what the code for the above steps might look like\npublic override void Render() {\n    // Mark modelview matrix as selected\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n\n    // Reset modelview matrix\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n\n    // Apply View Matrix\n    LookAt(\n        0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, \n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,\n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n\n    // Render grid, it has no model matrix\n    grid.Render();\n\n    // Construct the model matrix for first cube\n    GL.Translate(0.20f, 0.0f, -0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(73.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f);\n\n    // Render first cube\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    DrawCube();\n\n    // UNDO model matrix for first cube\n    GL.Translate(-0.20f, -0.0f, 0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(-45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(-73.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(20.0f, 20.0f, 20.0f);\n\n    // Construct model matrix for second cube\n\n    // Now that the modelview matrix is correct, render cube\n    GL.Translate(-2.5f, 0.0f, 0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(33.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(97.0, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f);\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    DrawCube();\n}\nStudy the code, if you run it you will see two cubes, one red and one green. This code does work!\nYou might be thinking to yourself, i see that applying the inverse of cube 1&#39;s model matrix just sets the modelview matrix back to the view. Instead of those 4 lines, why don&#39;t i just call LoadIdentity and LookAt again?\nThat logic is sound. Doing that would work, and you&#39;d make your program a bit more readable. But that&#39;s not a maintainable solution! As soon as you have nested objects that approach breaks.\nWe can&#39;t stay with the first approach either! It&#39;s verbose, it&#39;s messy and it has the potential to introduce a lot of floating point error.\nThe stack\nOpenGL fixes this issue of matrix-crazyness with matrix stacks! A matrix stack is exactly what it sounds like, a stack of matrices. There are two functions that you can use to control this stack:\nvoid GL.PushMatrix();\nvoid GL.PopMatrix();\n\nGL.PushMatrix will add a new matrix to the stack. This matrix is a copy of whatever the current top of the stack is\nGL.PopMatrix will take one matrix off of the stack\n\nAll matrix functions (LoadIdentity, LookAt, Translate, Rotate, Scale, etc...) only effect the top of the stack! This matrix stack acts as a history of matrices, allowing you to undo actions.\nThere is always at least one matrix on the stack, by default. This is what the state machine starts working on. For every PushMatrix call you make you MUST provide a matching PopMatrix.\nThe modelView matrix stack is guaranteed to be at least 32 elements deep. the projetion stack is only guaranteed to be 2 elements deep. Better graphics cards might provide deeper stacks.\nThe same list of steps we took at the top of this  page to render two cubes becomes this simple:\n\nSelect modelview matrix\nLoad itentity\nApply view matrix (LookAt)\nDraw grid\nPush Matrix (save modelView)\nApply cube 1 model matrix\nDraw cube 1\nPop Matrix (restore modelView)\nPush Matrix (save modelView)\nApply cube 2 model matrix\ndraw cube 2\nPopMatrix(restore modelView)\n\nBasically you push before making changes to the matrix, then pop to undo those changes. \nVisually, here is an example of the matrix stacks:\n\nFor example:\n// Stack height: 1\nGL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\nGL.LoadIdentity();\n// The top of the stack is now identity\n\nGL.PushMatrix(); // Stack height: 2\n// The top of the stack is still identity\n\nLookAt(\n    0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, \n    0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,\n    0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n);\n// The top of the stack is now whatever the camera sees\n\nGL.PushMatrix(); // Stack height 3\n// The top of the stack is still whatever the camera sees\n\nGL.Translate(3.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n// The top of the stack is now translated to 3.0f world space &amp; multiplied by the view matrix\n\nDrawModel();\n\nGL.PopMatrix(); // Stack height 2\n// The top of the stack is still whatever the camera sees\n\nGL.PushMatrix(); // Stack height 3\n// The top of the stack is still whatever the camera sees\n\nGL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n// The top of the stack is now rotated at origin &amp; multiplied by the view matrix\nDrawModel();\n\nGL.PopMatrix(); // Stack Height 2\n// The top of the stack is still whatever the camera sees\n\nGL.PopMatrix(); // Stack Height 1\n// The top of the stack is now identity\nOn your own\nMake a new demo. Render 3 cubes, one red one blue and one green. Use Push and Pop to save and restore matrix states between rendering them. Render all 3 at different locations on screen. When you are done, update git and let me know so i can review the code.\nHint: Keep the scale small, 0.05f or smaller. And don&#39;t translate mode than 1.0 units. I&#39;d try to keep under 0.5f. Remember, everything has to fit into NDC space!\n"},"Chapter4/projections.html":{"url":"Chapter4/projections.html","title":"Projections","body":"Projections\nWe&#39;ve mentioned projection transformations several times now, and even used them in code. It&#39;s about time we discuss how they work. As we&#39;ve pointed out there are two general classes of projections available in OpenGL: orthographic (or parallell) and perspective.\nBy setting a projection transform, you are, in effect creating a viewing volume, which serves two purposes. The first is that the viewing volume defines a number of clipping planes, which determine the portion of your 3D world that is visible at any given time. Objects outside the volume are not rendered.\nThe second purpose of the viewing volume is to determine how objects are draw. This depends on the shape of the viewing volume, which is the primary difference betwen perspective and orthographics render modes.\n\nBefore specifying any king of projection transformation you need to make sure that the projection matrix is the selected matrix stack. As with the modelView matrix, this is done trough the GL.MatrixMode function:\nGL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\nIn most cases you want to follow this up with a call to GL.LoadIdentity to clear out anything that might be stored in this matrix. Then you set the actual matrix. \nUnlike the modelView matrix, it&#39;s not likeley that the projection matrix will change much. Usually the only time this changes is when you resize the window.\nLets take a look at how to set the actual matrix\nOrthographic\nOrthographics projections are those that involve no perspective correction. In other words, no adjustment is made for the distance of the camera. Objects appear the same size on screen weather they are close up or far away.\nOpenGL provides the GL.Ortho function to set an orthographic projection:\nvoid GL.Ortho(float left, float right, float bottom, float top, float near, float far);\nLeft and right specify the X-coordinate clipping planes. Bottom and top specify the Y, and near and far specify the Z. This function essentially builds a box to render things in.\nThe default values of the orthographic projection are NDC space, or:\nGL.Ortho(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1);\nThis is cool, but it gives us a few issues. For one, all our geometry has to fit into the -1 +1 range! \nFollow along in a new sample project. Let&#39;s use our scene that draws one cube as a starting point:\npublic override void Render() {\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n\n    LookAt(\n        0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, \n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,\n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n    grid.Render();\n\n    GL.Translate(0.20f, 0.0f, -0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(73.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f);\n\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    DrawCube();\n}\nNow, the projection is the last step in the transform pipeline, because of that, it&#39;s the first thing we should multiply! Let&#39;s set a projection that&#39;s 5 times bigger than the default NDC space!\npublic override void Render() {\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    GL.Ortho(-5, 5, -5, 5, -5, 5);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n\n    LookAt(\n        0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f,\n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,\n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n    grid.Render();\n\n    GL.Translate(0.20f, 0.0f, -0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(73.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f);\n\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    DrawCube();\n}\nRun that code, all of a sudden you can see a lot more of the scene! Play around with the numbers, try 10, maybe even 15. See what a larger orthographic projection does. \nAs your projection matrix gets bigger, you can move your camera to positions other than 0.5f, as they will still hold the scene in View! Experiment a bit, see if you can predict what things will look like. Othro projection can be a bit of a trip!\nBefore we leave off, i just want to metnion, ortho projections don&#39;t have to be cubes. The following is perfectly valid:\nGL.Ortho(-1, 1, -1, 1, -100, 100);\nFun fact, the graphics manager for our 2D framework uses orthographic projection to render the sprites. Maybe take a peek at what it does.\nShape\nWhen you set your orthographic projection to be a sqare and resize your window to not be a square you will notice that the actual image on screen stretches or squashes. This is because we do not take aspect ratio into consideration!\nAspect ration effects the WIDTH of your projection, with respect to it&#39;s height. Therefore the aspect is width / height. Let&#39;s say you have the following projection:\nGL.Ortho(-10f, 10f, -10f, 10f, -100f, 100f);\nBut you want the rendered image to look the same no matter what size the window. All you have to do is find the aspect ratio of the window, and multiply the left and right arguments by it. Like so:\nfloat aspect = (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height;\nGL.Ortho(-10f * aspect, 10f * aspect, -10f, 10f, -100f, 100f);\nTest this by drawing a cube and resizing the window to be much wider than it is tall. Try it both with accounting for aspect ratio and without. See the difference between how the two look.\nPerspective\nAltough orthographic projections can be interesting (not always in a good way) you need to create perspective projections to make realistic looking images.\nIn a perspective projection, the further an object gets from the screen the smaller it becomes. Just like in the real world. This is commonly reffered to as foreshortening (that term will probably never come up again)\nThe viewing volume of a perspective projection is called a frustum (that term will come up all the time), which looks like a pyramid with the top cut off.\n\nThe projection matrix is actually a matrix that maps the Frustum into a cube that occupies NDC space! So, if you have a cube which ranges from -1 to +1 and multiply it by the inverse of the projection matrix you will get a visual for the frustum!\nWhen the projection matrix maps the frustum into a NDC cube, obejcts closer become smaller and object further become larger.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to set up a view frustum. The canonical way OpenGL provides is the GL.Frustum function.\nvoid GL.Frustum(float left, float right, float bottom, float top, float near, float far);\nIn the above function left ,right and bottom specify the X and Y coordinates of the near clipping plane. near and far specify the distance from the viewer to the near and far clipping planes. \nThis means that the top left corner of the near plane is at (left, top, -near) and the bottom right corner is at (right, bottom, -near). The corners of the far plane are determined by casting a ray from the viewer passing trough the near corners by a length for the far value.\nUsing GL.Frustum will allow you to set asymetrical frustums, which can be cool but are not very useful. At all. In fact, i never use GL.Frustum in my code, because it is a VERY hard way to picture a view frustum. Instead i use this helper function (add it to your code!)\npublic static void Perspective(float fov, float aspectRatio, float znear, float zfar) {\n    float ymax = znear * (float)Math.Tan(fov * Math.PI / 360.0f);\n    float xmax = ymax * aspectRatio;\n\n    GL.Frustum(-xmax, xmax, -ymax, ymax, znear, zfar);\n}\nWe will discuss the math behind this function later, in the custom matrices section. The arguments are much simpler, what is the field of view of the player. Human vision is about 90 degrees FOV, most games use a FOV of 60 because it looks good. The aspect ratio is simply the windows width divided by it&#39;s height. Don&#39;t forget to cast these to floats! And the near and far plane are just the length of the frustum.\n\nThis is again such a common function, almost every game programmer will recognize it&#39;s signature!\nLet&#39;s try to use it in our scene:\npublic override void Render() {\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    float aspect = (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height;\n    Perspective(60.0f, aspect, 0.1f, 100.0f);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    LookAt(\n        10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f,\n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,\n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n\n    grid.Render();\n\n    GL.Translate(0.20f, 0.0f, -0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(73.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f);\n\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    DrawCube();\n}\nTake note, i actually moved my camera to 10,10,10 to give a better look at the scene. Again, play around in here! Try moving the camera. Play with the arguments of Perspective, see how this works!\nIf you&#39;re feeling brave you can even try adding a second cube ;)\nOne question you may have is why 0.1 and 100 for the near and far planes. Well, i figured that&#39;s a pretty large visible area. There is really no easy formula to figure these values out, it&#39;s just whatever looks good for your game. I tend to start out with 0.01 and 1000.0, and adjust from there.\n"},"Chapter4/Viewport.html":{"url":"Chapter4/Viewport.html","title":"Viewport","body":"Viewport\nSome projection functions we just discussed are closely related to the viewport size. Take Perspective for example, we had to divide the viewport width and height. We know that the viewport transformation happens after the projection transformation, so now is as good a time as any to discuss it.\nIn essence the viewport specifies the dimensions and orientation of the 2D window on which you will be rendering. You can set it with:\nvoid GL.Viewport(int x, int y, int width, int height);\nx and y specify the coordinates of the lower left corner of the viewprot. Width and height specify window size in pixels. \nThe reson our windows didn&#39;t look the same up until this point is because we have had different default viewport values set. Once you are setting your own values for this our windows will look the same.\nLet&#39;s take the scene we rendered in the Projections section, and manually specify a viewport for it\npublic override void Render() {\n    // THIS IS THE ONLY NEW LINE!\n    GL.Viewport(0, 0, MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    float aspect = (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height;\n    Perspective(60.0f, aspect, 0.1f, 100.0f);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    LookAt(\n        10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f,\n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,\n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n\n    grid.Render();\n\n    GL.Translate(0.20f, 0.0f, -0.25f);\n    GL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(73.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f);\n\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    DrawCube();\n}\nNow your screen should look exactly like mine:\n\nSplit-Screen\nEver wonder how split-screen games are done? \n\nSpecify viewport to be half of the screen\nGL.Viewport(0, 0, screen.Width / 2, screen.Height)\n\n\nRender the game from player 1&#39;s camera. \nThe aspect ratio will be the aspect ratio of the viewport, not the window\n\n\nSpecify viewport to be second half of screen\nGL.Viewport(screen.Width / 2, 0, screen.Width / 2, screen.Height)\n\n\nRender game from player2&#39;s camera\n\nPixel perfect\nIf you are ever doing any 2D rendering and want it to be pixel perfect, set your viewport to whatever the screen size is\nGL.Viewport(0, 0, ScreenWidth, ScreenHeight);\nThen set your orthographic matrix to be that exact size\nGL.Ortho(0, ScreenWidth, ScreenHeight, 0, -1, 1);\nTake note how we map the left side of ortho to 0 and the right side to width.\nYou now have a pixel perfect render context. So, if you want to draw a line from pixels 4 to 7 you just draw from 4 to 7. This is how our 2D framework used to work.\n"},"Chapter4/roboto.html":{"url":"Chapter4/roboto.html","title":"Mr.Roboto","body":"Mr.Roboto\nNow that we can set the perspetive, model-view matrix and can position different elements using push and pop matrix lets make a complex scene.

I&#39;m also going to include a function called RenderRobot, i want to write the render code for the robot in it&#39;s own function, to make it re-usable and to keep the render loop clean.\npublic override void Render() {\n    GL.Viewport(0, 0, MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    Perspective(60.0f, (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    LookAt(\n        10.0f, 5.0f, 15.0f,\n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, \n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n\n    grid.Render();\n\n    DrawRobot(-1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n}\nThe draw robot function takes 3 arguments, world x, world y and world z. The cameras positon is 10, 5, 15 and it is looking at point 0, 0, 0. The near and far plane are almost 1000 units apart, so we can see just about anything in the scene.\nDraw Robot\nThis is going to be the basic function to draw our (un-animated) robot:\nvoid DrawRobot(float x, float y, float z) {\n    // Save the matrix state we enter this function with\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n\n    // Translate the robot to the desired coordinates\n    // because all body parts will be based off of this position\n    // we don&#39;t need to push a matrix here\n    GL.Translate(x, y, z);\n\n    // Draw the head, becuase it multiplies a position we have to push matrix\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // Red\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(1.0f, 4.0f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);\n        DrawCube();\n    GL.PopMatrix(); // finish head\n\n    // Draw the body\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // green\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(1.0f, 2.5f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.75f, 1.0f, 0.5f);\n        DrawCube();\n    GL.PopMatrix(); // finish body\n\n    // Draw left arm\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // blue\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(0.0f, 2.25f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.25f, 1.0f, 0.25f);\n    DrawCube();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    // Draw right arm\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // magenta\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(2.0f, 2.25f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.25f, 1.0f, 0.25f);\n        DrawCube();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    // Draw left leg\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // yellow\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.25f, 1.0f, 0.25f);\n        DrawCube();\n        // Draw left foot. Since nothing else uses the modellview matrix beofore\n        // the next pop, we don&#39;t have to technically include this push call.\n        // But i think including it makes it obvious that the foot is being\n        // drawn relative to the leg!\n        GL.PushMatrix();\n            GL.Translate(0.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f);\n            GL.Scale(1.0f, 0.25f, 2.0f);\n            DrawCube();\n        GL.PopMatrix();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    // Draw right leg\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); // baby blue\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(1.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.25f, 1.0f, 0.25f);\n        DrawCube();\n        // Draw right foot.\n        GL.PushMatrix();\n            GL.Translate(0.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f);\n            GL.Scale(1.0f, 0.25f, 2.0f);\n            DrawCube();\n        GL.PopMatrix();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    // Restore original matrix state, like if this function\n    // never did anything to matrices ;)\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n}\nThe comments in the code above outline what is happening, but lets discuss it real quick anyway. The robot is made up of 8 cubes. We first scale the cube into the shape of a certain body part. Once the body part has the right shape, we translate it into position.\nThe most interesting bit here are the feet on the legs. Because each foot is rendered inside the push / pop block of the leg it belongs to, when we rotate the leg we will also rotate the foot. \nHow did we come up with the scale (1.0f, 0.25f, 2.0f) for the feet? Well, if we don&#39;t translate or scale in there, just draw a cube it will draw the leg cube. We want the foot cube to be just as wide as the leg, so the X-scale stays 1. Relative to the leg, we want to foot to be 1/4 the height of the leg. So y scale becomes 0.25. We want the foot to be deeper than the leg, so it can jot out. Relative to the leg we want the foot twice as long, so we scale Z by 2.\nThis is an important concept. Each time we transform something, we are transforming it relative to the space it&#39;s in. The leg is relative to view space, the foot is relative to the legs model space. If we had toes they would be relative to the foots model space.\nThe concept of relative spaces is very important. If you don&#39;t understand it talk to me on skype!\nWith the above render code in place, your robot should render like so:\n\nAnimate\nAwesome! Now we have a robot!But it&#39;s not doing anything.... Lame. Let&#39;s animate some movement!\nTo add animation, all we have to do is account for rotation for all major joints. Left and right arms both rotate. Left and right legs both rotate. The left and right feed don&#39;t rotate independently, they rotate with the legs.\nHere is how you would rotate the left arm:\n// Draw left arm\nGL.Color3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // blue\nGL.PushMatrix();\n    GL.Translate(0.0f, 2.25f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Rotate(leftArmRot, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.25f, 1.0f, 0.25f);\nDrawCube();\nGL.PopMatrix();\nThe only thing new is we added Rotate to the transfomration matrix of the arm. Try to rotate the otehr limbs yourself.\nOnce you have all of this, you should see the limbs swinging. Only one problem, the arms are not rotating at the shoulder, they are rotating at the elbow! Same for the legs... \nPivot\nThe reason our rotations look messed up is because of how they pivot! To understand what&#39;s going on, lets discect what happens when you draw just one part of the robot, the left arm:\n\nWe start off with a unit cube, this is just some cube\nWe scale the cube, this gives it the correct porportion\nWe apply a rotation to the cube, this rotates the cube around it&#39;s own ceter\nWe position the rotated cube into it&#39;s final place\n\n\nWhere things break is step 3. The rotate function rotates the object around the center of the objects coordinate system, and thats why we don&#39;t pivot around the shoulder.\nHow can we fix this? Well, we know that all rotations happen around the origin of the objects model matrix. We can translate the model matrix so that the point we want to pivot is at it&#39;s origin, then do the rotation and then translate the model matrix back to how it was. This would give us control over where the pivot point goes.\nIf that sounds confusing, maybe this will clear it up:\n\nSo how would we do this pivoting for the left arm?\n// Draw left arm\nGL.Color3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // blue\nGL.PushMatrix();\n    GL.Translate(0.0f, 2.25f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Translate(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // UnPivot\n    GL.Rotate(leftArmRot, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Translate(0.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f); // Pivot\n    GL.Scale(0.25f, 1.0f, 0.25f);\n    DrawCube();\nGL.PopMatrix();\nIf you run with that code, the left arm will pivot around the shoulder joing. So, the question is, why do we move this joint by -1 on the y? \nTo answer that question, we still want to rotate around the center of the arm on the X and Z axis, we just want to rotate at the tip of the Y axis (on the top of the arm).\nIf you look at the cube being drawn, the Y scale is 1. Remember, the height of the cube is 2, because it goes from -1 to +1. Default rotation is around 0, 0. So to rotate around the tip of the arm we have to subtract 1, our pivot point is 0, -1.\nWhy -1, wouldn&#39;t +1 make more sense? Remember, in OpenGL positive Y goes down, negative Y goes up. If we pivoted to 0, 1 the arm would pivot around the fingers. Kind of the opposite of what we want.\nGo ahead and try to add pivots to the rest of the robot to complete it&#39;s walk-cycle.\n"},"Chapter4/nested.html":{"url":"Chapter4/nested.html","title":"Parent Child","body":"Matrix relationships\nWhat happened with the legs and feet of Mr.Roboto is super important. We must understand that each matrix manupulation we do, builds on top of previous matrix manipulations. Take the following code\nGL.Translate(-2, -1, 7);\n// Everything below this will be translated\nSo, when we wanted to foot of Mr.Roboto to move with the leg we had to multiply it while the model matrix of the leg was still on the stack.\nThis made the model matrix of the foot relative to the model matrix of the leg. \nIn OpenGL you can use indentation along with Push and Pop matrix to make these relationships very clear to understand.

And the stack makes working with matrices even easyer. But you already have a Matrix class built. Which already offers everything OpenGL matrices offer, and more! \nTour matrices are also a bit easyer to work with than OpenGL&#39;s because you have full control and know they are mathematically accurate. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if you could use your own matrices to work with OpenGL?\nGood news, you can!\nOpenGL Matrix\nThe OpenGL matrix has been confusing programmers since 1992. This next bit might get a bit confusing. So, bear with me; re-read the section if you need to and call me on Skype if you have questions.\nMathematically OpenGL uses column major matrices. Because the matrices are column major, OpenGL uses column vectors. This means OpenGL works post multiplication because a vector is a 4x1 matrix, so in order for inner dimensions to match it has to go on the right hand side of a matrix. matrix * vector. The matrices are right handed, that is -Z is forward, it goes into the monitor.\nEverything bolded in the above paragraph is the theoretical law of the land in OpenGL world. Write them on a notecard, memorize them! That is how the OpenGL specification says OpenGL matrices will work.\nA column major matrix has it&#39;s basis vectors in the first 3 columns and it&#39;s translation vector in the 4th column, like so:\nXx  Yx  Zx  Tx\nXy  Yy  Zy  Ty\nXz  Yz  Zz  Tz\n0   0   0   1\nTopology\nTopology refers to how the matrix is stored in memory, THIS is where OpenGL gets confusing. Consider the following column major matrix:\nXx  Yx  Zx  Tx\nXy  Yy  Zy  Ty\nXz  Yz  Zz  Tz\n0   0   0   1\nGiven that a matrix is stored as an array of floats (size 16) you would expect it to be laid out in memory like so:\n[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]\n Xx  Yx  Zx  Tx  Xy  Yy  Zy  Ty  Xz  Yz  Zz   Tz   0    0    0    1\nWhich makes sense, the matrix is stored 1 row at a time in a linear array. The X basis vector occupies elements 0, 4, 8 and 12. This is how your matrix works, and to be honest; this is how any sane persons matrix would be written.\nIn the above example, the matrix is stored linearly one row at a time.\nNot OpenGL\nIn OpenGL the following (still column major) matrix:\nXx  Yx  Zx  Tx\nXy  Yy  Zy  Ty\nXz  Yz  Zz  Tz\n0   0   0   1\nIs stored in memory like this:\n[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]\n Xx  Xy  Xz  0   Yx  Yy  Yz  0   Zx  Zy  Zz   0    Tx   Ty   Tz    1\nThat is, the matrix is stored one column at a time. Instead of storing each row in memory one after another, OpenGL stores each column in memory, one after another. \nThis is actually a very un-intuitive way to store a matrix. So, why does OpenGL do it this way? When the standard for the OpenGL Matrix was defined in 1992 the hardware of the time could run three times faster with this memory layout. Today it&#39;s a neusance, a major source of confusion and annoyment. But we have to keep doing things this way for historical reasons.\nTake a few minutes, let that sink in. See if you can figure out how the following matrix would be stored in OpenGL&#39;s memory and in your matrices memory. Keep in mind, the matrix is stored in a 1 dimensional float array that has 16 elements. Let me know on skype before moving on to the next section:\nA B C D\nE F G H\nI G K L\nM N O P\nTranspose\nThe takeaway from the above section is actually rather simple, while you use the same theoretical memory layout as OpenGL (column major, post multiplication) you actually store your data in memory transposed of how OpenGL store it&#39;s data in memory.\nThis just means that before you load your own custom matrix into OpenGL, you must transpose it.\nLoading a matrix\nNow with all that theory out of the way, how do you actually load a matrix into OpenGL? There are two functions, the first one isGL.LoadMatrix. This function takes an array of float&#39;s as an argument:\nvoid GL.LoadMatrix(float[] matrix);\nThis function will take the matrix passed into it, and REPLACE whatever is on the top of the stack with the matrix. It&#39;s useful for loading the view matrix, but after that you can&#39;t really use it for much else without ruining the view matrix.\nThe second method is GL.MulMatrix, like LoadMatrix it takes an array of 16 floats:\nvoid GL.MulMatrix(float[] matrix);\nUnlike LoadMatrix, MulMatrix respects the top of the stack. It&#39;s going to take whatever argument you give it and multiply the top of the matrix stack by that argument. This is the function you wan to use to load custom matrices onto an existing stack\nSample\nLet&#39;s see how to use it. Make a new demo scene that extends the Game class. We will need the LookAt, Perspective and DrawCube functions. Also include a grid.\nDraw a cube at 1, 0, 0; rotated 45 degrees on the x axis; with a scale of 0.5f. \nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class MatrixDemo1 : Game {\n        Grid grid = null;\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            grid = new Grid();\n        }\n\n        protected static void LookAt(float eyeX, float eyeY, float eyeZ, float targetX, float targetY, float targetZ, float upX, float upY, float upZ) {\n            // Copy / paste\n        }\n\n        public static void Perspective(float fov, float aspectRatio, float znear, float zfar) {\n            // Copy / paste\n        }\n\n        public static void DrawCube() {\n            // Copy / paste\n        }\n\n        public override void Render() {\n            GL.Viewport(0, 0, MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n            GL.LoadIdentity();\n            Perspective(60.0f, (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\n\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n            GL.LoadIdentity();\n            LookAt(\n                10.0f, 4.0f, 0,\n                0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, \n                0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n            );\n\n            grid.Render();\n\n            GL.PushMatrix();\n                GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n                GL.Translate(-2, 1, 3);\n                GL.Rotate(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n                GL.Scale(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);\n                DrawCube();\n            GL.PopMatrix();\n        }\n    }\n}\nHere is what this screen looks like:\n\nLet&#39;s see if we can replace the model matrix of the rendered cube with our own custom matrix. \nCheck Math Implementation on github, i opened a new ticket. Fix it before moving on! When you&#39;re using custom matrices and things don&#39;t render correctly (but they did with OpenGL matrices) the problem is always with your implementation. Even if it passed a few unit tests, the real word scenario sometimes breaks down.\nFirst thing&#39;s first, import your math implementation code into the project. Keep things clean, put those files under a folder in visual studios solution view. I&#39;d also like you to put your demo scenes in their own folder, like this:\n\nMake sure to use the namespace these where implemented under using Math_Implementation;. The namespace OpenGK also contains a Matrix4 class, so make sure you are not using the namespace directly. Meaning this is ok: using OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL; but don&#39;t do this: using OpenTK;.\nReplacing the OpenGL matrices.\nLet&#39;s look at the render funtion with your custom matrices in place:\npublic override void Render() {\n    GL.Viewport(0, 0, MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    Perspective(60.0f, (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n    GL.LoadIdentity();\n    LookAt(\n        10.0f, 4.0f, 0,\n        0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, \n        0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f\n    );\n\n    grid.Render();\n\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n    {\n        Matrix4 scale = Matrix4.Scale(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));\n        Matrix4 rotation = Matrix4.AngleAxis(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n        Matrix4 translation = Matrix4.Translate(new Vector3(-2, 1, 3));\n\n        // SRT: scale first, rotate second, translate last!\n        Matrix4 model = translation * rotation * scale;\n        // Remember to transpose your matrix!\n        GL.MultMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(model).Matrix);\n\n        DrawCube();\n    }\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n}\nAs you can see we create 3 matrices: scale, rotation and translation. We make the model matrix for the cube by combining the 3 transformation matrices we created. Because we&#39;re in column major (post multiplcation) we multiply right to left.\nAs discussed, we can&#39;t apply the matrix directly, because we&#39;re storing it in a different manner than OpenGL expects. So, we transpose the matrix before giving it to OpenGL. \nWe use GL.MulMatrix. When that call is reached the only thing on the stack is the view matrix. GL.MulMatrix will multiply our matrix into the view matrix to create a modelView matrix.\nWe still need to push and pop matrices. We do this to restore the top of the matrix stack to the view matrix, in case anything else needs to be rendered.\nOne thing you may have noticed is i put a { } block inside GL.PushMatrix and GL.PopMatrix. Why did i do this?\nWell, we made 4 local matrices: scale, rotation, translation and model. Instead of those matrices being scoped to the function, they are now scoped to those brackets. So, if we have two cubes, we can re-use the matrix names as the ones up there fall out of scope when the } is hit.\nLike this:\npublic override void Render() {\n    // Omitted to save space, everything up to grid.Render is here\n\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n    {\n        Matrix4 scale = Matrix4.Scale(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));\n        Matrix4 rotation = Matrix4.AngleAxis(45.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n        Matrix4 translation = Matrix4.Translate(new Vector3(-2, 1, 3));\n\n        Matrix4 model = translation * rotation * scale;\n        GL.MultMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(model).Matrix);\n\n        DrawCube();\n    }\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n    {\n        Matrix4 scale = Matrix4.Scale(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));\n        Matrix4 rotation = Matrix4.AngleAxis(45.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n        Matrix4 translation = Matrix4.Translate(new Vector3(5, 3, -4));\n\n        Matrix4 model = translation * rotation * scale;\n        GL.MultMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(model).Matrix);\n\n        DrawCube();\n    }\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n}\nAs you can see i can create matrices by the same name, without reusing the old ones because they are scoped to local code blocks denoted by { } pairs.\n"},"Chapter4/ProjectionAndLookAt.html":{"url":"Chapter4/ProjectionAndLookAt.html","title":"Projection & LookAt","body":"The missing functions\nOne of the nice things about being able to use your own matrices in OpenGL is having to rely less on the OpenGL functions. After all, you don&#39;t really know what those functions are doing under the hood! If we want to fully break away from OpenGL we have timplement 3 more functions into our Matrix4 class: Ortho, Frustum and LookAt.\nMake these changes in the Math Implementation repository, once they are working, copy the Matrix4.cs file into your OpenGL1X repository, replacing the old file.\nAll three of these functions are going to be static! They don&#39;t modify any existing matrix, just return a new matrix specifying some sort of transformtaion!\nDeriving matrices is hard. I honestly have no idea how to derive an Orthographic projection matrix. What i will preset below is the formulas i&#39;ve memorized and the things that work for me. If you want to be mathematically accurate, this  tutorial is a decent walktrough of how to derive the matrices. It&#39;s not a skill you will ever need, i&#39;ve never used it once.\nOrtho\nHow OpenGL makes an orthographic matrix is not a secret. It&#39;s actually outlined in the OpenGL specification. Use the following image to create your own Matrix4.Ortho function:\n\nYou can test this by changing the projection fo Mr.Roboto from the perspective projection to:\nfloat aspect = (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height;\nGL.Ortho(-25.0f * aspect, 25.0f * aspect, -25.0f, 25.0f, -25.0f, 25.0f);\nTake not of what it looks like, then replace the GL.Ortho call with your own matrix:\nfloat aspect = (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Width / (float)MainGameWindow.Window.Height;\nMatrix4 ortho = Matrix4.Ortho(-25.0f * aspect, 25.0f * aspect, -25.0f, 25.0f, -25.0f, 25.0f);\nGL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(ortho).Matrix);\nThe two screens should look the same.\nFrustum\nRe-implementing OpenGL&#39;s Frustum function is not too difficult either, as the math behind it is toroughly documented. This matrix is one of the few matrices who&#39;s element [3,3] is not 1.\n\nThe formula is available as text on the OpenGL man page. I know D is a bit hard to read it&#39;s D = -((2 * far * near) / (far - near))\nYou can test if your function is correct, by changing the Mr.Roboto sample back to using it&#39;s original projection matrix. Then replace the Perspective function with one that uses your frustum instead of the built in one:\npublic static void Perspective(float fov, float aspectRatio, float zNear, float zFar) {\n    float yMax = zNear * (float)Math.Tan(fov * (Math.PI / 360.0f));\n    float xMax = yMax * aspectRatio;\n\n    //GL.Frustum(-xMax, xMax, -yMax, yMax, zNear, zFar);\n    Matrix4 frustum = Matrix4.Frusum(-xMax, xMax, -yMax, yMax, zNear, zFar);\n    GL.MultMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(frustum).Matrix);\n}\nLook At\nLookAt is an interesting beast, as it is not a part of the OpenGL specification. It&#39;s not really a part of OpenGL. The LookAt function was made popular by a library called GLU (GL Utilities).\nI&#39;m going to walk you trough creating the LookAt function step by step both the theory and the code. \nWe start with the funtion signature. We&#39;ve already discussed what these arguments do, i won&#39;t discuss them here.\n public static Matrix4 LookAt(Vector3 position, Vector3 target, Vector3 worldUp) {\nWe can create a vector from the camera to the target by subtracting position from target (to get a vector pointing from position to target. If we normalize this vector to have a magnitude of 1 it becomes the forward basis (z) vector for the cameras coordinate system.\n    Vector3 cameraForward = Vector3.Normalize(target - position);\nRemember when you cross two vectors the result is a vector that&#39;s perpendicular to both. We can cross the world up vector with the cameras forward to get a vector to the right side of the camera. If we normalize this vector, the result will be our right basis (x) vector.\n    Vector3 cameraRight = Vector3.Normalize(Vector3.Cross(cameraForward, worldUp));\nNow that we know the up and the right vector of the camera&#39;s coordinate system we need to figure out it&#39;s up vector. The up is going to be perpendicular to forward and right, so we simply take their cross products. Because both matrices are normalized, we don&#39;t need to normalize this.\n    Vector3 cameraUp = Vector3.Cross(cameraRight, cameraForward);\nNow that we have all 3 basis vectors that make up the cameras coordinate system, let&#39;s combine them into a matrix! Remember, in OpenGL -z is forward, so we have to negate our foward vector.\n    Matrix4 rot = new Matrix4(cameraRight.X, cameraUp.X, -cameraForward.X, 0.0f,\n                              cameraRight.Y, cameraUp.Y, -cameraForward.Y, 0.0f,\n                              cameraRight.Z, cameraUp.Z, -cameraForward.Z, 0.0f,\n                              0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\nThat takes care of the rotation, but the camera has a position in the world too! Let&#39;s create a translation matrix for it:\n    Matrix4 trans = Matrix4.Translate(position);\nNow it goes to reason the camera matrix will be rot * trans. But remember, the view matrix is the inverse of the camera matrix. So we must invert these matrices before returning them:\n    return Matrix4.Inverse(rot) * Matrix3.Inverse(trans);\n}\nAnd thats it! You now have a working LookAt function! Make sure it works by replacing the existing LookAt in MR.Roboto with yours, like so:\nGL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\nGL.LoadIdentity();\n//LookAt(10.0f, 5.0f, 15.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nMatrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(\n    new Vector3(10.0f, 5.0f, 15.0f),\n    new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f),\n    new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)\n);\nGL.MultMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\nFaster LookAT\nBy far the most improtant part of our LookAT function is this line:\nreturn Matrix4.Inverse(rot) * Matrix3.Inverse(trans);\nDoing one matrix inverse is pretty expensive. Doing two is worse!  We know that a translation matrix looks like this:\n1, 0, 0, Tx\n0, 1, 0, Ty\n0, 0, 1, Tz\n0, 0, 0, 1\nWe also know that it&#39;s inverse simply looks like this:\n1, 0, 0, -Tx\n0, 1, 0, -Ty\n0, 0, 1, -Tz\n0, 0, 0, 1\nSo it stands to reason that we can speed this up, if instead of inverting the translation matrix we build it using the inverse of the position vector:\nMatrix4 trans = Matrix4.Translate(position * -1.0f);\nreturn Matrix4.Inverse(rot) * trans;\nHey that&#39;s awesome! If we run the game with this look at function everything looks the same. Now, the big question is, can we somehow get rid of that other Inverse? Surprisingly the answer is yes.\nThe rot matrix we have above is VERY special. It&#39;s what we call an ortho-normal matrix. An ortho normal matrix is a matrix who&#39;s basis vectors are perpendicular to each other, and are all of unit length. Our rot matrix meets this criteria.\nNow for the special part. If an ortho-normal matrix has NO TRANSLATION (which the rot matrix does not), it&#39;s inverse is the same as it&#39;s transpose! Crazy! This is super special case and works in only a few specific instance. This is one of those instances. This means we can rewrite the last two lines as:\nMatrix4 trans = Matrix4.Translate(position * -1.0f);\nreturn trans * Matrix4.Transpose(rot);\nAnd now we have no Inverse functions in the LookAt function at all!\nConveniance getter\nHaving to type out \nMatrix4.Transpose(frustum).Matrix\nevery time we want to use one of our custom matrices with OpenGL is very time consuming. We can save a LOT of time by adding a simple getter to the matrix class that returns the matrix as a transposed array of floating point numbers. How OpenGL is expecting it:\npublic float OpenGL {\n    get {\n        return Transpose(this).Matrix;\n    }\n}\nThere, much nicer. Now if i want to load my own matrix, i just have to:\nMatrix4 frustum = Matrix4.Frusum(-xMax, xMax, -yMax, yMax, zNear, zFar);\nGL.MultMatrix(frustum.OpenGL);\nConveniance perspective:\nWe now have a Frustum function in our Matrix class. But to set a Perspective projection we still call the Projection helper function. Now that we know how a frusum matrix is made, and we know the math of Projection, why don&#39;t we just make a function in Matrix4 that returns a straight up projection and makes it so we don&#39;t have to mess with any helper functions?\nLet&#39;s go ahead and do that. All you really have to do is to move the Perspective helper into the matrix class, and return the final matrix. \nYou know the drill, test it out by replacing the old function.\n"},"Chapter4/CustomStack.html":{"url":"Chapter4/CustomStack.html","title":"Make your own stack","body":"Your own stack\nAt this point in our look at the transformation libary, we are no longer dependant on the built in OpenGL matrices! Go us! But we&#39;re still using the OpenGL stack. Which as we know has a set size.

The biggest difference between what OpenGL does and what we do is that OpenGL no longer knows when you multiplied matrices together. Therefore it becomes important for us to tell OpenGL to use the matrix on the top of the stack for rendering, every time we draw simething.

They can either look identical, or be different, it&#39;s up to you. Once using only OpenGL matrices, and once using only your own matrices. This does mean you need to write two demo classes that extend the game class.\nAssignment\nI want you to write an application that draws a grid, and on top houses a small solar system.

You can download my version to see how this should work in action. This is what mine looks like:\n\nDrawing a sphere\nDrawing a sphere is by no means a trivial task. Unlike a cube it&#39;s hard to plot down on paper and get the vertex coordinates. The default method of drawing a spehere is to draw a sub-divided icosahedron. 90% of the time the code used to do this copied from the red book.\nThis is no exception to that rule. I&#39;ve ported the code from the red-book to C# and we will be using that. Get the code from here, add it to your project.\nThere is only one static function you need to use:\nGLGeometry.DrawSphere(int ndiv);\nThe argument ndiv is how many times the sphere should be sub-divided. The more sub-divisions the worse the performance, but the better your scene looks. In my scene i subdivided the sun 3 times, the planets 1 time. Here is the difference between subdiv levels:\n\nRotate around things\nRotating around things is a matter of matrix multiplication order. The standard order we use SRT rotates an object around it&#39;s own origin, not around other objects.

The last thing we need to discuss before wrapping things up is where to put what functions. You may have noticed that the width and height of your window does not change, therefore neither does your projection matrix. Is there any reason to re-calculate it every frame? Not really. So where should this calculation take place?\nYou only need to set the viewport, and the projection matrix when the window is created or resized. Further-more so long as you set the matrix mode to modelview every time after setting the projection matrix you will not need to select a matrix mode in your render function.\nThe view matrix by definition needs to be re-calulated each frame. And so does the model matrix. Let&#39;s take a look at how all of this fits into your application.\nThe first thing to do is to add a Resize function to your Game.cs class. This will be where we set our projection:\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class Game {\n        public virtual void Initialize() {\n\n        }\n        public virtual void Update(float dTime) {\n\n        }\n        public virtual void Render() {\n\n        }\n        public virtual void Shutdown() {\n\n        }\n        public virtual void Resize(int width, int height) {\n\n        }\n    }\n}\nMake sure to call the function in Program.cs, like so\nprotected override void OnResize(EventArgs e) {\n    base.OnResize(e);\n    Rectangle drawingArea = ClientRectangle;\n    TheGame.Resize(drawingArea.Width, drawingArea.Height);\n}\nWe want to make sure that a default projection matrix is set as soon as the window appears, so we need to change the main function in Program.cs to manually call resize as soon as the game is created.\n[STAThread]\npublic static void Main(string[] args) {\n    //create new window\n    Window = new MainGameWindow();\n    Axiis = new Grid();\n    TheGame = new MrRoboto();\n    // ----------------------------------------\n    // v This is new\n    TheGame.Resize(Window.Width, Window.Height);\n    // ^ This is new\n    // ----------------------------------------\n    Window.Load += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Initialize);\n    Window.UpdateFrame += new EventHandler&lt;FrameEventArgs&gt;(Update);\n    Window.RenderFrame += new EventHandler&lt;FrameEventArgs&gt;(Render);\n    Window.Unload += new EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;(Shutdown);\n\n    Window.Title = &quot;Game Name&quot;;\n    Window.ClientSize = new System.Drawing.Size(800, 600);\n    Window.VSync = VSyncMode.On;\n    //run 60fps\n    Window.Run(60.0f);\n\n    //Dispose at end\n    Window.Dispose();\n}\nAnd that&#39;s all the infrastructure support we need.

We will take a quick detour into one method for drawing shadows, then we&#39;ll look at how transparency and other effects can be achieved trough blending. Finally we will look at OpenGL&#39;s built-in fog support.\nIn this chapter we are going to cover\n\nColors in OpenGL\nShading\nOpenGL lighting\nLight sources\nMaterials\nBlending and Transperancy\nFog\n\n"},"Chapter5/using_colors.html":{"url":"Chapter5/using_colors.html","title":"Using Colors","body":"Using colors in OpenGL\nWhen you pass primitives to OpenGL, it assigns colors to them by one of two methods: either by using lighting calculation or using the current color. When lighting is used the color for each vertex is computed based on a number of factors, including the position and color of one or more lights, the current materia, the vertex normal and so on. If lighting is disabled, then the current color is used instead. \nIn RGBA mode, (this is the only mode we are going to be using), OpenGL keeps track of a primary and secondary color consisting of Red, Blue, Green and Alpha components. The alternate to RGBA mode is Color Index mode, which has not been used since the mid 90&#39;s.\nSetting the Color\nIn RGBA mode, you specify colors by indicating the intensity of the RGBA components. Just because you specify an alpha component doesn&#39;t mean OpenGL will draw the shape you are drawing transparent. You need to enable blending for that; something we will discuss later in this chapter.\nThe color components are usually expressed as a floating point number from 0 to 1, 0 being minimum, 1 being maximum. That means black is (0, 0, 0, 0) and white is (1, 1, 1, 1).\nTo specify the primary color in OpenGL you will use one of the many variations of:\nvoid GL.Color3(...);\nvoid GL.Color4(...);\nThe one we&#39;ve been using takes 3 floats as an argument, i suggest you keep using that one. But the function does have many overrides. When using Color3, the alpha value is automatically set to 1. When using Color4, you must specify the alpha value.\nSecondary color\nIn OpenGL 1.4 the concept of a secondary color was introduced. This secondary color was added for a lighting effect known as specular highlights. It never gained much traction, you will probably never use it. But we discuss it for the sake of completeness.\nTo use the secondary color, you must enable it first\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.ColorSum)\nAfter it&#39;s been enabled, you can set it with \nGL.SecondaryColor3(...)\n"},"Chapter5/shading.html":{"url":"Chapter5/shading.html","title":"Shading","body":"Shading\nSo far we&#39;ve talked about and used GL.Color to set the color of each vertex. But how does OpenGL decide what color to use in the middle of a triangle (not at a vertex)? If all 3 vertices are the same color, then obviously the middle will be that color. But what happens if you use a different color for each vertex? List so:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n    GL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(-0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.Color3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.End();\nTo find out lets simplify the problem. Imagine a line with two different colors. Let&#39;s keep things simple, one vertex is black, the other is white. So, what color is the line it&#39;s self? Well, that entireley depends on the shading-model being used.\nShading can either be flat or smooth. When flat shading is used the entire primitive is drawn with a single color. \nWhen using flat shading, each vertex in a primitive can have a different color, OpenGL must chose one of them for the color of the primitives. For lines, triangles and quads the color of the last vertex is used. For triangle strips, triangle fans and quad strips the color of the last vertex in each sub-triangle is used. For polygons, the color of the first vertex is used.\nThe line we discussed earlyer would be white if it was flat shaded. Because the last vertex is white.\nSmooth shading on the other hand is based on the Gouraud Shading Model. This is the more realistic of the two shading models. In this mode, colors are interpolated along the face of the primitive.\nThe line with smooth shading would look like this:\n\nSmooth shading on a polygon works the same way as it does for a line. For example, here is a triangle:\n\nNow that you what how these shading models are, how do you use them? The GL.ShadeModel funciton lets you specify the shading model to use.

It is one of the few elements that can make or break the realism of your 3D game. So far, you&#39;ve looked at how to build objects, move object, color objects and shade objects. Now let&#39;s look at how to make these objects come to life with materials and lights.\nOpenGL Lighting and the Real World\nLet&#39;s take a quick step back and look at a simple explanation of how light woks in the real worlds. Light sources produce photons of many different wavelengths, colvering the full spectrum of color. Many of these photons strike objects, which absorb some of them and reflect others. The reflected photons might be reflected uniformly (smooth shiny surfaces) or they may get scattered (rough, matte sourfaces). The reflected photons may strike other objects and repeat the process. We are able to see objects because some of these photons eventually enter our eyes\nModelling the complex interaction of light photons with even a small number of objects (one) is computationally expensive. So much so that it is not feasable to do with an interactive framerate. This type of rendering is refered to as ray tracing, not to be confused with ray-casting which we have done.\nOpenGL (and other graphics API&#39;s) use simplified lighting models that trade accuracy for speed. Altough the results will not match the real world exactly, they are close enough to be believable. \nOpenGL calculates lighting by approximating the light into Red, Green and Blue components. This means that the color a light emits is determined by the amount of red,green and blue light it emits.\nLight is further broken down into four different terms, which together atempt to simulate the major effects seen in real-world ighting:\n\nAmbient Light simulates the light bouncing between surfaces so many times that the source of the light is no longer apparent. This components is NOT affected by the position of the light or the position of the viewer.\nDiffuse Light comes from a certain direction, once it strikes a surface it is reflected equally in all directions. The figguse light components IS affected by the position (direction) of the light, but NOT the position of the viewer.\nSpecular Light is drirectional and is reflected off a surface in a particular direction. Specularity is often refered to as shininess. the speculer term is effected by BOTH the position (direction) of the light AND the viewer.\nEmussive Light is a cheap way to simulate objects that emit light. OpenGL will not actually use the emissive term to illuminate nearby objects, it simply causes the emissive object to be more intensly lit.\n\nThe final results of lighting depend on several major factors, each of which will be discussed in detail ater. the factors are:\n\nOne of more light sources. Each light source will have the ambient, diffuse, specular and emmisive terms listed above. Each specified as RGBA values. In addition they will either have a position or direction, or have terms that affect the attenuation and may have a limited area of affect.\nThe orientation of surfaces in the scene. This is determined trough theuse of normals, which are associated with each vertex.\nThe material each object is made of. Material properties define what precentages of the RGBA values each ligt term should be reflected. They also define how shiny a surface is.\nThe lighting model, which includes a global ambient term (independent of any light source) and wether or not the position of the viewer has an effect on lighting calculations. \n\nWhen the light strikes a surface, OpenGL uses the material of the surface to determine how much R, G and B light should be reflected by the surface. Even tough they are approximations, the equations used by OpenGL can be computed very quickly and produce reasonably good results.\n"},"Chapter5/lightsources.html":{"url":"Chapter5/lightsources.html","title":"Light Sources","body":"Light sources\nIt&#39;s time to turn some lights on and get on with the show! Like most GL.Enable calls, you want to enable lighting in the initialize of your program.\nYou can enable lighting like so:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\nThis call causes the lighting equasion to be applied to every vertex, but it does not turn on any lights. You need to explicitly turn lights on by calling:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.LightX);\nWhere X is a number between 0 and 7 (inclusive). The OpenGL specification dictates that OpenGL will support a minimum of 8 lights. Some implementations support more, but 8 is the safe number.\nOnly 8?\n8 lights might not seem like a lot. That&#39;s because 8 lights is not a lot. It&#39;s a very conservitive number. This is largly because lighting is expensive. Enabling just 4 lights might cause a noticable drop in framerate.\nYou&#39;ve no doubt seen games (Even those built on OpenGL 1X, like Doom3) that use way more than 8 lights! How do they do it? Well, if you are standing in the living room, the living room light has an effect on you. But the bedroom light does not.\nLights are enabled and disabled PER OBJECT. This means object A can be drawn with 2 lights, object B can be drawn with 6 and object c can be drawn with 3. Assuming each light is unique, we just drew a scene with 11 lights. But we didn&#39;t break OpenGL, because each indevidual object only enabled the lights that effect it.\nLight properties\nEach world light has several properties associated with it that define it&#39;s position or direction in the world, the colors of its ambient, diffuse, specular and emissive terms and weather the light radiates in all directions or shines in a specific direction. \nThese parameters are configured trough the following functions:\nvoid GL.Light(LightName name, LightParameter param, float val);\nvoid GL.Light(LightName name, LightParameter param, float[] val);\nThe first argument is an enumeration of type LightName, it&#39;s going to have a value of LightName.Light0 trough LightName.Light7. This argument specifies which lights properties you are modifying.\nThe second argument is an enumerationof type LightParameter which tells openGL which value is being modified. These are the valid values:\n\nAmbient Ambient intensity of the light\nDiffuse Diffuse intensity of the light\nSpecular Specular intensity of the light\nPosition Position of the light as a vector4 (x, y, z, w)\nSpotDireciton Direciton of the spot light as a vector3 (x, y, z)\nSpotExponent Spotlight exponent\nSpotCutoff Spotlight cutoff\nConstantAttenuation Constant attenuation\nLienarAttenuation Linear atenuation\nQuadraticAttenuation Quadratic attenuation\n\nLets discuss each of these settings briefly before actually using them in code.\n"},"Chapter5/pad.html":{"url":"Chapter5/pad.html","title":"Position and direction","body":"Position and Direction\nEach light can have either a position or a direction. Lights with a position are often called positional lights or point lights. directional lights on the other hand are infinitley far away, they have no position. There are no true direcitonal lights in nature, since nothing is infinitley far away. But some light sources are so far away they can be treated as directional lights (like the sun).\nSo why use a direcitonal light instead of a really big point light (like how the sun actually works)? Performance. Directional lights are (marginally) cheaper than spot lights. Admitedly, on modern hardware this is no longer a problem.\nYou can set a lights position by passing LightParameter.Position to the GL.Light function. The function will then take a 4 element array of floats (x, y, z, w) representing either the lights position or direction. The w component is used to indicate if the vector passed in is a position or a direction vector. A w of 0 is directional, a w of 1 is positional.\nHere is how you could set the direciton of a light\n// direction must be normalized\nfloat[] lightDir = { 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f};\n// We pass in a direciton vector, this is going to be a directional light\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParamater.Position, lightDir);\nIf i wanted to set up a positional or point light\nfloat[] lightDir = { 2.5f, 3.5f, 7.0f, 1.0f};\n// We pass in a position vector, this is going to be a point light\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParamater.Position, lightDir);\nThe default position for all lights is (0, 0, 1, 0), it is directional, pointing down the negtive Z axis.\nIMPORTANT: Whenever you make a call to GL.Light with LightParamater.Position the vector you specify is transformed by the current modelview matrix, just as vertices are, and stored in eye coordinates. We will discuss this in more detail later.\n"},"Chapter5/light_color.html":{"url":"Chapter5/light_color.html","title":"Light Color","body":"Light Color\nLight sources are composed of three of the lighting terms we discussed earlyer: ambient, diffuse and specular. These 3 terms combined make up the final lighting of the geometry. Illustrated in this image:\n\nTo set up each of these terms you call GL.Light with a parameter name of LightParameter.Ambient, LightParameter.Diffuse or LightParameter.Specular. Each of these takes a four component float array. The values passed in represent the RGBA color of the specified term. The following code demonstrates:\nfloat[] white = new float[]{1, 1, 1, 1};\nfloat[] blue  = new float[]{0, 0, 1, 1};\n\n// Set ambient term blue\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, blue);\n// Set diffuse term blue\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, blue);\n// Set specular term white\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, white);\nThe above code and image match. Note how in the image the ambient and diffuse terms are both blue, and the specular term (the highlight) is white. Adding all the terms up produces the final image.\nThe default value of every term for all lights is black (0, 0, 0, 1) with two exceptions: Light 0 has a default diffuse and specular term of white (1, 1, 1, 1)\nBecause this concept is pretty important, here is another image demonstrating it:\n\n"},"Chapter5/light_atten.html":{"url":"Chapter5/light_atten.html","title":"Attenuation","body":"Attenuation\nIn the real world, the farther an object is away from a light, the less effect that light has on the object. For example, if you look at a street lamp at night (especialy in the fog) you&#39;ll be able to see the intensity of the light dropping off away from the lamp. This phenomenon is known as attenuation.\n\nThis effect is modelled by OpenGL using an attenuation factor, which can reduce the effect of a lights contribution to the color of an oject based on the distance to the object. The attenuation factor is calulated as follows:\n\n\nEach factor has a default of (1, 0, 0) which results in no attenuation by default. You can change the factors by passing LightParamater.ConstantAttenuation, LightParamater.LinearAttenuation and LightParamater.QuadraticAttenuation to the GL.Light function. Each of these attenuation factors takes a single floating point number as an argument.\nThis sample code sets all attenuation factors\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.ConstantAttenuation, 4.0f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.LinearAttenuation, 1.0f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.QuadraticAttenuation, 0.25f);\nAttenuation factor affects only positional light sources, it makes no sense in terms of a directional light as the direcitonal light is infinitaley far away. \nNot intuitive\nOpenGL chose this attenuation model because it is pretty close to how nature actually looks / works. The problem is they lost all intuition with this formula. When setting a point light i expect to be able to say &quot;I want a light with a radious of 5, attenuation should start 2 units away from the center&quot;. \nThere is no intuitive way to set the attenuation of a point light. You have to play around with it until it looks the way you want it to. It&#39;s actually so bad, i built an application that renders a sphere on a plane with an attenuated spot light and has sliders for all factors. I play with the sliders until it looks good and copy the values into my code\n"},"Chapter5/light_spotlight.html":{"url":"Chapter5/light_spotlight.html","title":"Spotlights","body":"Spotlights\nNormally positional lights radiate in all directions. However you can limit the effect of the line to a cone. This would look like a flash light, the effect is called a spotlight.\nTo create a spotlight, you set up a positional light like you normally would and then set a few spotlight-specific paramaters: cutoff, direction and focus.\nCutoff\nLets think about what a spotlight looks like for a moment. If you where looking at a spot light in pure darkness, you would see that the light creates a cone of light in the direction that the spotight is pointing.\n\nWith OpenGL, you can define how wide this cone of light should be by specifying the angle between the edge of teh cone and its axis by passing LightParameter.SpotCutoff to GL.Light.\n\nA cutoff value of 10 for example results with a spotlight whose cone spreads out 20 degrees. OpenGL accepts only values between 0 and 90 for this paramater, with the special exception of 180. 180 is the default value and turns the spotlight into a regular point light.\nThis is the code you would use to create a spotlight with a 30 degree cone\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.SpotCutoff, 15.0f);\nDirection\nThe next paramater to specify is the direction that the spotlight is facing. This is done with the LightParameter.SpotDirection paramater, which takes a 3 component vector (x, y, z). The default direction is (0, 0, -1), which points the spotlight down the negative z axis.  You can specify your own direction like so:\n// Direction vector is normalized\nfloat[] direction = {0, 0.5, -0.5};\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.SpotDirection, direction);\nExponent\nAnd finally you can specify the focus of the spotlight, which can be defined as the concentration of the spotlight in the center of the light cone. As you move away from the center of the cone the light is attenuated until there is no more light at the edge of the cone.\n\nYou can use LightParameter.SpotExponent  to control this. A higher exponent results in a more focused light, that drops off quickly. Here is an example of setting the exponent to 10:\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.SpotExponent, 10.0f);\nThe spot exponent can range from 0 to 128. A value of 0, which is the default results in no attenuation, so the spot light is evenly distrubuted\nUsage\nHow often are spot lights used? Not that much. Even modern games, like Assasins Creed tend to use point lights for things like street lamps. The point light is cheaper calculation wise (not by much) and easyer for artists to configure.\n"},"Chapter5/move_and_rotate.html":{"url":"Chapter5/move_and_rotate.html","title":"Moving and Rotating","body":"Moving and rotating\nWhat do you need to do to make a light move around? Think about how you would make any other object in the world move around. One way is to set the position of the object after you translate or rotate it. You can do the same thing with lights. When you call GL.Light to define the position or direction of a light, the information you specify is in local space. It will be transformed by the current modelview matrix.\nStatic Lights\nFor static lights, lights that never move it makes sense to position the light after you set up the camera (after calling LookAt for example) but before applying any other transformations to the modelview matrix. We rendered our reference grid like this. No matter where the objects in the scene or the camera moved, the reference grid is static at origin. Same thing would happen for lights.\nPerspective Lights\nHow about perspective lights? What&#39;s a perspective light? It&#39;s a light that stays fixed relative to the eye (camera) position. For instance, when you sit in a car, the headlights are perspective lights. They stay in more or less the same position relative to your eyes. In this case you would set the modelview matrix to indentity, then define your light at the origin, and then continue transformations as you normally would\nGL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.ModelView);\nGL.LoadIdentity();\n\n// Position the cars lights at origin, this can be anywhere,\n// it doesn&#39;t have to be at origin.

But i don&#39;t feel like it demonstrated clearly how to actually use lights. That&#39;s what this chapter is all about. In this chapter we&#39;re going to create several demo scenes, some together, some on your own to create some fully lit scenes\nChanging the grid\nBefore we get started, there are a few things we need to change within our code to get well lit objects. First, in order to actually view lighting, it helps to have a solid ground plane. Let&#39;s modify the grid class to optionally draw a solid plane.\nFirst, let&#39;s add a public boolean that is going to control the render mode. By default drawing a filled in grid is going to be off (So that we don&#39;t break any of the example scenes we&#39;ve already written)\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class Grid {\n        // Control if the grid is rendered solid or not\n        public bool RenderSolid = false;\n\n        public Grid() {\n            RenderSolid = false;\n        }\n\n        public Grid(bool solid) {\n            RenderSolid = solid;\n        }\nNow, let&#39;s modify the render function to actually render the solid grid. Remember, our grid is 20 units wide, and centered around the 0 point. So the far left is -10, the far right is 10. We&#39;re going to draw one large quad to cover this area. The quad is going to be a dark gray. \nWe&#39;re going to draw the quad at -0.01f on th Y axis. We do this because i still want the grid to render, this way the quad renders just underneath the grid and will look pretty good. \nLets add this to the begenning of the render function:\npublic void Render() {\n    // Only render this bit if solid is enabled\n    if (RenderSolid) {\n        // Set the color to a dark gray\n        GL.Color3(0.4f, 0.4f, 0.4f);\n        // Draw one large rectangular primitive\n        // this large rectangle is 2 triangles ;)\n        GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n            GL.Normal3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n            // Triangle 1\n            GL.Vertex3(10.0f, -0.01f, 10.0f);\n            GL.Vertex3(10.0f, -0.01f, -10.0f);\n            GL.Vertex3(-10.0f, -0.01f, -10.0f);\n            // Triangle 2\n            GL.Vertex3(10.0f, -0.01f, 10.0f);\n            GL.Vertex3(-10.0f, -0.01f, -10.0f);\n            GL.Vertex3(-10.0f, -0.01f, 10.0f);\n        GL.End();\n    }\n    // ... The rest of the render function stays the same\nThe only thing that&#39;s kind of unfamiliar in there is this bit:\nGL.Normal3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\nThe normal of a surface is used in lighting calculations. It tells OpenGL which way an object is facing. A normal is just a unit vector that points in the direction that the primitive faces. We will talk in depth abut normals soon.\nThats all the changes we need to make to the grid. If you run one of the existing samples, and turn on RenderSolid on, your scene should look something like this:\n\nAdditional Geometry\nYou added the DrawCube function to every program that uses it. And you added the function DrawSphere to a calss called Circle. There is nothing wrong with this, its a solid approach. The circle code is better than the cube code for the sake that it is more portable.\nHowever, neither solution is robust. Ideally you will have many different primitives to render, so we need a class that is a convenient holder for them. I would call this class either Primitives or Geometry. Go ahead and create this class in your project.\nAdd the code found at this gist to the class. Don&#39;t copy any of the existing code in your project, the gist is special in that it adds normal information (we will cover this later) for each primitive. The following static functions are exposed for you:\npublic static void Geometry.Cube();\npublic static void Geometry.Sphere(int nDiv = 2);\npublic static void Torus(float ringRadius = 0.2f, float tubeRadius = 0.8f, int numc = 6, int numt = 12)\nAs you can see, every argument has a default value, so you can call these functions without arguments. Cube and Sphere work like they always have. I&#39;ve added some sensible defaults. Torus is new, what is a torus? It&#39;s essentially a doughnut. This is what a torus looks like:\n\nWhen calling the function, the first argument is the radius of the ring, that is the radius of the actual tube which makes up the ring. The second argument is the radius of the tube. Imaging, that the ring is stretched around a tube, this is the radius we define here. So, first argument is how thick the geometry is, second argument is how large the hole in the center is. \nThe last two arguments are the number of segments to subdivide. The first one decides how many slices to give, the second one how many columns. Like with the sphere, the larger these numbers, the more detail the torus will have.\nThe test scene\nWith that we now have all the elements we are going to be using for our lighting test scene. For every lighting demo from here on, copy this scene, rename it and implement the light. For the scene, we&#39;re going to render a cube a spehere and a torus on top of a grid. And the camera is going to be slowly orbiting the scene to give us a 360 degree view of the lighting.\nLet&#39;s build out the test scene, we&#39;re going to start with the initialize method:\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class LightingScene : Game{\n        Grid grid = null;\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            grid = new Grid(true);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\n            Resize(MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n        }\nThe first thing we do here is make a new solid grid object. We enable DepthTest, because we want the 3D objects to sort properly. We enable CullFace to save some performance by not rendering back-facing triangles. Finally, we call the Resize method, to set up our projection and viewprots. Let&#39;s take a look at said resize method next:\npublic override void Resize(int width, int height) {\n    GL.Viewport(0, 0, width, height);\n    float aspect = (float)width / height;\n\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n    Matrix4 perspective = Matrix4.Perspective(60.0f, aspect, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\n    GL.LoadMatrix(perspective.OpenGL);\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n}\nThis is a pretty standard resize method. Nothing to really talk about here. And finally lets take a look at how we are going to be rendering the scene:\n public override void Render() {\n    Vector3 eyePos = new Vector3();\n    eyePos.X = 0.0f;\n    eyePos.Y = 5.0f;\n    eyePos.Z = 10.0f;\n\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(eyePos, new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));\n    GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\n    grid.Render();\n\n    GL.Color3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(0.0f, 2.5f,-2f);\n        Primitives.Torus();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    GL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(2.5f, 1.0, -0.5f);\n        Primitives.DrawSphere();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    GL.Color3(0f, 0f, 1f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(-1f, 0.5f, 0.5f);\n        Primitives.Cube();\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n}\nAgain, nothing to brag about here. We set up a pretty standard view matrix, then render the grid, and then translate and render each primitive using their default values. The torus renders green, the sphere red and the cube blue. Your screen should look like this:\n\nNow, let&#39;s rotate the camera! To orbit the camera around the scene, let&#39;s first add 3 variables to our program: angleX, angleY and distance:\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class LightingScene : Game{\n        Grid grid = null;\n\n        float cameraAngleX = 0.0f;\n        float cameraAngleY = -25;\n        float cameraDistance = 10.0f;\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            // ... rest of code unchanged\nThe cameras distance from what it&#39;s looking at isn&#39;t going to change, neither is the height at which the camera is looking from (cameraAngleY). But we&#39;re going to rotate the camera around the Y axis. For this, override the update method:\npublic override void Update(float dTime) {\n    cameraAngleX += 30f * dTime;\n}\nNow that the angle is updating properly, lets modify the render code to respect these values. The following code should look familiar, it&#39;s standard rotation code that you&#39;ve derived before.\npublic override void Render() {\n    Vector3 eyePos = new Vector3();\n    eyePos.X =  cameraDistance * -(float)Math.Sin(cameraAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(cameraAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    eyePos.Y =  cameraDistance * -(float)Math.Sin(cameraAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    eyePos.Z = -cameraDistance * (float)Math.Cos(cameraAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(cameraAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(eyePos, new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));\n    // ... rest of code unchanged\nThe only thing new here is that we are multiplying the rotated angle by cameraDistnace. That&#39;s because our angle rotation returns between 0 and 1 (radians). If we multiply that by the distance of the camera, it makes the camera orbit around an imaginary sphere.\nTry running the code, and confirm that the camera is rotating the scene. After this we are done, and read to actually start implementing some lights!\n"},"Chapter5/direction.html":{"url":"Chapter5/direction.html","title":"Directional Light","body":"Directional lights\nDirectional lights are perhaps the easyest to program. They are simply a direction that the light comes from, like sunlight. Let&#39;s give it a go.\nFollow along, make a new scene for each sub-section here. For this (Directional Light) section alone you should have 6 test scenes.\nAdding one light\nThe first thing we need to do is enable lighting and light 0. This isn&#39;t necesarley something that needs to happen every frame, so lets handle it in the initialize function.\npublic override void Initialize() {\n    grid = new Grid(true);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\n    Resize(MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n}\nNow we are ready to do some lighting! I&#39;m going to set light 0 to be a blue light comming from the upper front of the scene. For now, the light is static (it doesn&#39;t change from frame to frame) so it&#39;s safe to configure in the Init function as well.\npublic override void Initialize() {\n    grid = new Grid(true);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\n    Resize(MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n\n    float[] white = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\n    float[] blue = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 1f, 1f };\n\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f } );\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, blue );\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, blue );\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, white );\n}\nThat&#39;s all there is to it. If you run your code, it should look like this:\n\nLight direction\nIt may not be obvious from the previous example, but OpenGL shades (lights) objects independently! That is, no object casts a shadow on another object. When the light is comming from the top, like in the above scene it&#39;s easy to miss that. So, let&#39;s change the light direction to come from the negative Y axis!\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0.0f, -0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f } );\nLet&#39;s take a look at what that looks like:\n\nAs you can see the shading on the primitives has changed, the floor is the most noticable. In the first example, the floor got a LOT of light, in the second example, the floor is unlit. This happens because in the second example the floor is facing away from the light.\nIn the real world, the floor would stop light from reaching the objects. In OpenGL each object is shaded and lit indevidually, like if no other object was in the scene. It is possible to add code to support shadows, but it&#39;s a complicated process that we will talk about later.\nTwo Lights\nSo, actually using a light us pretty easy. OpenGL supports up to 8 lights! Let&#39;s try to add one more and see what happens. We&#39;re going to add a second light, this one is going to be red. It&#39;s going to come from the Opposite direction of the blue light from the original example.\nFirst things first, in the Initialize function we have to enable and configure light 1:\npublic override void Initialize() {\n    grid = new Grid(true);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\n    Resize(MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light1);\n\n    float[] white = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\n    float[] blue = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 1f, 1f };\n    float[] red = new float[] { 1f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\n\n    // Config light 0\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f } );\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, blue );\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, blue );\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, white );\n\n    // Config light 1\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0.0f, -0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Ambient, red);\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Diffuse, red);\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Specular, white);\n}\nLets see what that looks like:\n\nThe top of any object is shaded blue. The bottom is shaded red. Colors in the middle interpolate between the two lights, based on the direction of the surface normal.\nOn your own\nUsing the last example, add a third light (Light2). Configure this light to point straight left (1, 0, 0, 0), and be green. The final scene should look like this:\n\nThe torus and cube are especially interesting as we look at this scene. The floor is also noteworthy too. It&#39;s compleatly blue! That&#39;s because the floor gets blue light from the top. It&#39;s facing away from the red light on the bottom, and is paralell to the green light. So the red and green lights don&#39;t directly effect it.\nBut every time we added a light, the floor became a different shade of blue! If the lights don&#39;t directly effect floor, why is it&#39;s color changing? Ambient light. Each light adds a bit of ambient light to the scene. Remember, ambient lighting is light that has scattered so much it has no direction, so it uniformly effects everything in the scene!\nThe lighting models diffuse component is direct lighting, the ambient component is indrect lighting and the specular component is shininess! So, can we turn off the ambient light? Yes. Set the ambient component of any light that you don&#39;t want an ambient contribution from to black. Because black is RGB(0, 0, 0), it is absent of color, therefore it has no contribution to lighting.\nDynamic lights\nWe now have a scene lit by 3 static lights. But lighting in OpenGL can be so much more than just static lights. It can be dynamic! Lights can move with objects! Using the previous scene as a base, let&#39;s animate the lights! \nWe&#39;re going to make the green light orbit the scene horizontally, the red light orbit the scene vertically, and we&#39;re going to make the camera stay static.\nFirst, let&#39;s add some variables to the scene. We&#39;re going to use the same orbit logic we used for the camera, so these variables will be simialr.\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class LightingScene : Game{\n        Grid grid = null;\n\n        float cameraAngleX = 0.0f;\n        float cameraAngleY = -25;\n        float cameraDistance = 10.0f;\n\n        float redAngleX = 0.0f;\n        float redAngleY = 0.0f;\n\n        float greenAngleX = 0.0f;\n        float greenAngleY = 0.0f;\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            // ... rest of code unchanged\nWe have an X and a Y angle for both lights, we don&#39;t have a distance, to keep the vectors of unit length, we will use 1.0f for the distance. Next lets change the Update function to stop rotating the camera, and start rotating the lights!\npublic override void Update(float dTime) {\n    //cameraAngleX += 30f * dTime;\n\n    redAngleY += 15.0f * dTime;\n    greenAngleX += 30.0f * dTime;\n}\nNow that the actual rotation logic is in place, all that&#39;s left to do is actually rotate the lights. We do this by changing the LightParameter.Position parameter of light 1 (red) and light 2 (green) every time a frame is rendered. \npublic override void Render() {\n    Vector3 eyePos = new Vector3();\n    eyePos.X =  cameraDistance * -(float)Math.Sin(cameraAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(cameraAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    eyePos.Y =  cameraDistance * -(float)Math.Sin(cameraAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    eyePos.Z = -cameraDistance * (float)Math.Cos(cameraAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(cameraAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(eyePos, new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));\n    GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n    grid.Render();\n\n    // Compute position of red light\n    Vector3 redPosition = new Vector3();\n    redPosition.X = 1.0f * -(float)Math.Sin(redAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(redAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    redPosition.Y = 1.0f * -(float)Math.Sin(redAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    redPosition.Z = -1.0f * (float)Math.Cos(redAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(redAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n\n    // Compute position of green light\n    Vector3 greenPosition = new Vector3();\n    greenPosition.X = 1.0f * -(float)Math.Sin(greenAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(greenAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    greenPosition.Y = 1.0f * -(float)Math.Sin(greenAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n    greenPosition.Z = -1.0f * (float)Math.Cos(greenAngleX * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0)) * (float)Math.Cos(greenAngleY * (float)(Math.PI / 180.0));\n\n    // Update light positions every frame\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { redPosition.X, redPosition.Y, redPosition.Z, 0.0f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light2, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { greenPosition.X, greenPosition.Y, greenPosition.Z, 0.0f });\n\n    // ... rest of code unchanged\nRunning your scene now, you can see that the lights are changing in real time. But it&#39;s pretty hard to get a firm grasp of what is happening. We can kind of see where the lights are coming from, but not really. Lets add some debug code to actually visualize the lights.\nWe&#39;re going to render two lines, one for the red light, one for the green light. They are going to have a local origin somewhere in space, and will point in the direction that the lights are pointing in. Both of the lines will be of unit length to make debugging easyer. \nThe only catch is, because we are rendering the lines in a lit scene, we can&#39;t really define a set color for them; becuase the lighting equasion ignores GL.Color3. So to cope with this we&#39;re going to disable lighting in the middle of our draw function, draw the indicators and re-enable the lights after.\n// Update light positions every frame\nGL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { redPosition.X, redPosition.Y, redPosition.Z, 0.0f });\nGL.Light(LightName.Light2, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { greenPosition.X, greenPosition.Y, greenPosition.Z, 0.0f });\n\n// Add some debug visualization so we can see the direction of the lights\n// Disable lights, so the color of the lines comes from GL.Color, not lighting\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\nGL.PushMatrix();\nGL.Translate(4f, 4f, 0f);\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n// Draw red ray\nGL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0f, 0f, 0f);\nredPosition.Normalize(); // We want to render a unit vector\nredPosition *= -1.0f; // Invert so we see the light direction\nGL.Vertex3(redPosition.X, redPosition.Y, redPosition.Z);\n// Draw green ray\nGL.Color3(0f, 1f, 0f);\nGL.Vertex3(0f, 0f, 0f);\ngreenPosition.Normalize();\ngreenPosition *= -1.0f;\nGL.Vertex3(greenPosition.X, greenPosition.Y, greenPosition.Z);\nGL.End();\nGL.PopMatrix();\n// Re-enable lights, we want the rest of the scene lit\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n\n// ... rest of code unchanged\nRunning your game now, you should have a nice indicator as to which way your lights point, the scene looks like this:\n\nThis is a really good example of rendering a lit scene with some unlit objects. At any point during your objects execution you can enable / disable lighting as a whole, you can enable / disable specific lights; OR you can change indevidual properties of specific lights. This is how we are able to do so much with just 8 lights, they can be 8 different lights for every object!\nIndependently lit objects\nIn games (ang movies) it&#39;s common to have &quot;local lights&quot;. A local light is a light that an artists places in a scene, and is attached to a model (using the matrix stack, the same way a foot is attached to a leg). The light moves with a specific character and effects only the character. So a character is lit by the scene lighting, and then some extra character specific lighting to really make it pop.\nMovies take this one step further, and have lights only affect certain parts of a character. In Tangled, Flynn had 8 lights attached to him that only affected his hair! Highlights where added to the hair using local lights.\nWe need independently lit objects to do local lighting. The process for doing local lights and the process for light culling (having the bedroom light not affect objects in the kitchen) is the same. We simply disable lights that don&#39;t effect the object, and configure the lights that do affect it appropriateley.\nWe&#39;re going to make a new scene using the final Dynamic Lights scene as a base. This is what we are about to render\n\nThe tarus only be lit by the green light\nThe sphere lit only by the red light\nThe cube will be lit by the blue light and a purple light.   \nInstead of adding a 4th light (Light3) to the scene, we&#39;re going to recycle the red light and turn it purple\nThe purple light will be static. \n\n\nThe floor will be lit only by the blue light.\n\nThe torus and sphere are simple, we just need to enable / disable lights before drawing each of them. Update your render code to reflect this:\n// We want to set the state of all 3 lights here\n// because this is the first lit object that is drawn\n// The enable / disbale states carry over from last frame\n// so setting all states here acts as a kind of reset\n\n// Disable blue light\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light0);\n// Disable green light\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light2);\n// Enable the red light\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light1);\n\n// Draw tarus\nGL.PushMatrix();\nGL.Color3(0f, 1f, 0f);\nGL.Translate(0.0f, 2.5f,-2f);\nPrimitives.Torus(0.2f, 0.8f, 6,12);\nGL.PopMatrix();\n\n// Right now, only the red light is enabled, disable it\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light1);\n// The green light is still disabled, enable it\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light2);\n// We don&#39;t need to disable light 0, it&#39;s still disabled from last call\n\n// Draw sphere\nGL.PushMatrix();\nGL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f);\nGL.Translate(2.5f, 1.0, -0.5f);\nPrimitives.DrawSphere(1);\nGL.PopMatrix();\nRun the game, see what it looks like. The cube and the rest of the scene are only a little bit more complicated as we need to actually update the color and of the red light to essentially become a new purple light. Lets update the render function to reflect these changes:\n // Disable the green light\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light2);\n// Enable the red light\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light1);\n// Enable the blue light\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n\n// Change the color of light 1 from red to purple\nfloat[] purple = new float[] { 1f, 0f, 1f, 1f };\nGL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Diffuse, purple);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Ambient, purple);\n// Specular component can stay white\n// Update the position of light 1 so it&#39;s static (purple will just have a static direction)\nGL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0.0f, -0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f });\n\n// Draw cube\nGL.PushMatrix();\nGL.Color3(0f, 0f, 1f);\nGL.Translate(-1f, 0.5f, 0.5f);\nPrimitives.Cube();\nGL.PopMatrix();\nRun the game to see what it looks like. The sphere is rendered green like we wanted. The cube is rendered purple and blue like we wanted. The ground is rendeed purple and blue like we wanted. The torus however is wrong! It&#39;s not red, it&#39;s purple and blue! Why?\n\nThe answer is simple, nothing is reset for you. Ever! At the end of the frame we set light 1 to be purple, which means that at the start of the next frame it will still be purple! This is an easy fix. We want the ground to render blue / purple still, but the next object, the torus to render in red. \nWe know that the tarus renders with light 1, so let&#39;s change the color of light1 to red after drawing the ground. Lets update the render code to reflect this:\ngrid.Render();\n\nfloat[] red = new float[] { 1f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\nGL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Diffuse, red);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Ambient, red);\n\n// ... rest of code unchanged\nA bit off topic, but the reason the ground is using the same lighting as the cube is becuase it renders with whatever configuration the state machine was left in at the end of last frame. In this situation, this is what we want, sometimes it may not be. But this does imply an interesting artifact. It&#39;s not visible, because the timing is so short, but the first frame that the appliction runs the ground is actually colored wrong. Because the render has not executed before, so the state machine is not in the state we expected it to be. However this error is only for 1 frame, so we can ignore it. Your app at this point should look like this:\n\nOne thing to note, even tough we have independently lit objects in this scene, we don&#39;t actually have local lights. This is because all of the lights are static to the scene, none of the lights move with objects in the scene. Local lights don&#39;t make much sense with a directional light. We will implement them when doing point lights.\n"},"Chapter5/point.html":{"url":"Chapter5/point.html","title":"Point Light","body":"Point Lights\nThe code for point lights is very similar to the code for directional lights. You can think of a directional light as the sun, a point light is more like a light-bulb. It&#39;s a point in space that emits light, the further the light gets from the point, the less it&#39;s influance is. \nUnlike directional lights, point lights do have a position, which means the matrix stack and the model-view matrix become incredibly important. You ALWAYS have to set the position of a point light in your render loop, after the view matrix has been set\nSingle Static Light\nLets start by adding a single, static point light to our test scene. We will have the light be near origin, and large enough to illuminate all objects in the scene. For this, the light will be yellow. \nIn the Initialize function enable lighting and light 0. Set the color of the light to yellow RBG(1, 1, 0). Remember, to set the color of a light you need to set it&#39;s ambient, diffuse and specular components. Also, the lgiht color is a 4 component array, the last component being alpha!\nStill in initialize, after the color of the light is set up, we need to set the lights position. The position is a 4 component vector (float array),with the W component being 1.\n// Having a W of 1 makes the lgiht a point light with a position\nfloat[] position = new float[] { 0f, 1f, 0f, 1f };\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, position);\nIf you run your game now, you get the following scene:\n\nThat does not look right. Not at all. The whole scene is lit, nothing about that says point light to me. Before continuing reading, think about why you think this is broken.\nWell, a point light has two major properties, a position and a radius. And frankly, we set the position wrong. Remember, the Position is affected by what&#39;s in the modelview matrix. But in the Initialize function, that matrix is essentially trash! So, we must also set the position of the light in the render function. After the modelview is built, but before we render anything.\n GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\nfloat[] position = new float[] { 0f, 1f, 0f, 1f };\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, position);\n\ngrid.Render();\nWith that code in place, the scene now looks like this:\n\nThat looks so much better! It&#39;s actually starting to look like a lightbulb eluminating the scene! But why is everything an ugly mustard color? That doesn&#39;t look right! Well, that&#39;s the ambient component of the light. Remember how light works, the diffuse component is applied to an object where the light touches it. The ambient component is applied everywhere, it represents light that bounced around a lot and is now just ambient. The specular component is shininess.\nWith a large light, like the sun, or a super intense light, like what they use on a construction site it makes sense to have an ambient component. But with a small light (like a light bulb) it does not. Usually a bulb is only strong enough to light a small area, not a large room! With that being said, change the ambient term from yellow to black. This should leave the diffuse term yellow, the ambient term black and the specular term white. \nThis will leave your scene looking like this:\n\nWow, we almost have it! Some things are black, there is a yellow light that fades over distance, there is just one problem. Look at the ground. It&#39;s not lit! Before reading on, think about why this might be occuring.\nThe answer is a tad technical, but this has to do with how OpenGL handles lights. See, OpenGL doesn&#39;t calculate lights per pixel, it calculates the light color of every vertex. When drawing a triangle, it calculates the color of all 3 vertices, and then just interpolates them like normal.\nRemember how the ground (under the grid) is just two large triangles? Well, none of the triangle&#39;s vertices happen to fall into the attenuation zone. Therefore, the gound is rendered as if it was ALL outside the attenuation zone, even the parts that are inside. This is a VERY common problem with per vertex point lights. Large meshes tend to get lit wrong.\nHow can we fix this? By adding more vertices! The higher density your mesh is (the more tesselated your mesh is), the more accurate your lighting will become. I&#39;m going to give you some code that takes a quad, and divides it into 4 quads before rendering. It&#39;s a recursive function, so you can sub-divide a quad as many times as you want. Add this to the Grid class:\nprivate static void SubdivideQuad(float l, float r, float t, float b, float y, int subdivLevel, int target) {\n    if (subdivLevel &gt;= target) {\n        GL.Vertex3(l, y, t);\n        GL.Vertex3(l, y, b);\n        GL.Vertex3(r, y, b);\n\n        GL.Vertex3(l, y, t);\n        GL.Vertex3(r, y, b);\n        GL.Vertex3(r, y, t);\n    }\n    else {\n        float half_width = Math.Abs(r - l) * 0.5f;\n        float half_height = Math.Abs(b - t) * 0.5f;\n\n        SubdivideQuad(l, l + half_width, t, t + half_height, y, subdivLevel + 1, target);\n        SubdivideQuad(l + half_width, r, t, t + half_height, y, subdivLevel + 1, target);\n        SubdivideQuad(l, l + half_width, t + half_height, b, y, subdivLevel + 1, target);\n        SubdivideQuad(l + half_width, r, t + half_height, b, y, subdivLevel + 1, target);\n    }\n}\nNow modify the Render function so it takes an optional subvidision paramater (0 by default), and instead of manually drawing out two large triangles it calls the subdivide function i just gave you:\npublic void Render(int subdiv = 0) {\n    // Draw grid\n    if (RenderSolid) {\n        GL.Color3(0.4f, 0.4f, 0.4f);\n        GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n        {\n            GL.Normal3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);\n            SubdivideQuad(-10, 10, -10, 10, -0.01f, 0, subdiv);\n        }\n        GL.End();\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of code is unchanged\nNow change the render function of your demo scene to use a subdivision of 1. See what it looks like. When it doesn&#39;t look good, change it to 2, repeat until it tooks good. I decided 4 would be the one i use. This is because 4 is the first subdivision where you can see the light as a circle on the ground!\n\nAlmost there, one last problem, why is the cube black! On every side! The answer is so simple it&#39;s hard to track the bug down sometimes. The light is INSIDE the box! Because the light is inside the geometry, all the faces face the same way as the light, and no face is lit. Change the light position to:\nfloat[] position = new float[] { 0.5f, 1f, 0.5f, 1f };\nNow as your scene rotates, you will see one of the sides of the cube lit! \nThats it, we&#39;re done. It may seem like we went trough a lot of issues to get a single point light up, that&#39;s because we did. I made sure to include all of the major mistakes that get made when seeing up lights above. Chances are you will make those mistakes (i still do), when that happens i want you to have the tools to fix them\nAttenuation\nFor this section, start with the scene we got at the end of the last section. Now that we can render a point light in the scene, and have it look pretty ok, how do we change the radius / size of the light?\nThat&#39;s where attenuation comes in. Like the color of the light, you can set it&#39;s attenuation in Intialize for now, it doesn&#39;t need to be set every frame. If you remember, attenuation is an inverse function (it starts with 1.0f /... ). This means the lower the attenuation factors, the stronger / larger the light.\nUp to this point our point light has used the default attenuation values set by OpenGL. The default attenuation is:\n\nConstant, 1\nLinear, 0\nQuadratic, 0\n\nNow, seeing how a point light can be visualized as essentially a large sphere, common sense would tell us that there is some way to configure attenuation by defining a radius and some strength. There is not. The attenuation model OpenGL choose looks physically accurate, but there is no common sense way to configure it. You just have to play with the numbers.\nFor example, try setting a &quot;neutral&quot; attenuation like so:\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.ConstantAttenuation, 0.25f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.LinearAttenuation, 0.25f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.QuadraticAttenuation, 0.0f);\nThe lighting in the scene has barley changed. The center is a bit more well-lit, but the area of effect for the light is almost unchanged.\nLets try introducing a quadratic term:\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.ConstantAttenuation, 0.25f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.LinearAttenuation, 0.25f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.QuadraticAttenuation, 0.25f);\nAs you can see, the area of effect for the light remains mainly the same, however the brightness of the light has been reduced significantly.\nLike i mentioned previously, the closer to 0 your attenuation factors are the stronger the light is. Lets expand the lights area of influence, as well as it&#39;s brightness. Try the following:\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.ConstantAttenuation, 0.01f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.LinearAttenuation, 0.1f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.QuadraticAttenuation, 0.0f);\nAll of a sudden the point light is huge! That&#39;s all there is to point lights. You set a position, keeping in mind that the modelview matrix effects this position, and you make sure to configure the lights attenuation.\nFinding good attenuation\nOne of the hardest things to do with point lights is finding a decent attenuation factor. Artists will play around with the attenuation numbers for hours before choosing the final attenuation of a light.\nHow did i find the attenuation numbers we used in the above examples? I wrote a small program:\n\nThe program is simple, it has a few geometry objects (VERY HIGHLY TESSELATED), i subdivide everything by 10 to ensure there are enough verts that the lighting looks great. This pulls my CPU up to 50% usage whenever i run the program, but i only run it for short ammounts of time.\nIn this program i can type in numbers for the lights attenuation factors, color, position, etc. I can also click and drag on the text boxes to step each factor the attenuation by 0.001f\nI highly suggest making something similar. Tough not required, it will REALLY help you out later. The test scene we have set up right now is actually a really good start. If you don&#39;t want to invest time in writing a UI, you can make your interaction be simple.\nIf i was to write a simple interaction application (which is what i did in school), pressing Q and W would step the constant factor by 0.001f, A &amp; S would step the Linear factor by 0.001f, and Z &amp; X would step the quadratic factor by 0.001f. Similarly i&#39;d have E &amp; R, D &amp; F, C &amp; V also modifying the appropriate factors by 0.01f, and T &amp; Y, G &amp; H, B &amp; N modifying the factors by 0.1f. I&#39;d makethe P button reset all attenuation to 0.\nSo, if you set up your input to modify the attenuation, how can you read back what it is? You could build a font rendering interface, it&#39;s something you&#39;ve already done for the dungeon game. OR you could do what i do for quick and dirty programs, set the title bar every frame!\nMainGameWindow.Window.Title = &quot;Constant:&quot; + constantFactor + &quot;, Linear: &quot; + linearFactor + &quot;, Quadratic: &quot; + quadraticFactor;\nThis way you can build a quick application for yourself that will let you play with attenuation settings in about an hour. It might not be super user friendly, but it will get the job done.\nYou don&#39;t have to buildthis application as a part of this chapter, but if you decide invest the time in building it now it might save you some trouble down the line.\nLocal lights\nA common use of point lights is to use them as local lights. That is lights that are attached to objects, and move with objects. In an entity-component system, you might have a PointLightComponent class for this that you can attach to a game object. I might configure a scene like this\nRoot (game object)\n    World (game object)\n        Lamp (game object)\n            Light (game object with light component)\n        Lamp (game object)\n            Light (game object with light component)\nThat way each lamp object also has a light object that is offset relative to it. And i don&#39;t have to find the world position for every light, because the light is relative to the lamp, each light will have the same relative offset.\nA really creative use of a local light is Navi from zelda. Navi is local to link, wherever link moves Navi follows. But Navi also moves independently, flying around link. Navi has a small radius that eluminates wherever she is. The designers leveraged this, by making navi also be used as a lighting device, whenever you read a sign she flies to it and slightly eluminates it, putting emphasis on the sign being read.\nWith that in mind, let&#39;s create a simple local light. We&#39;re going to keep the scene illuminated by our yello light, but we&#39;re going to add a local red point light to the sphere. This will only light the sphere. Once the light is added, we will animate it to orbit the shere, because local lights don&#39;t have to be static.\nStart by enabling Light1 in the initialize function. Set it&#39;s diffuse color to red, ambient color to black and specular color to white. Set the attenuation of this new light to the default values, Constant: 1, Linear: 0, Quadratic: 0. So far everything has been pretty standard. Now comes the part that makes this light a local light.\nWe are going to enable Ligh 1 just before the sphere is drawn, and Disable it right after, this ensures that only the sphere is lit. Then, we are going to set the light position AFTER the model matrix for the sphere has been configured.\n// Only affect sphere\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light1);\nGL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.PushMatrix();\n{\n    GL.Translate(2.5f, 1.0f, -0.5f);\n    // Set light position, so it&#39;s relative to sphere\n    position = new float[] { -2f, 0f, -2f, 1f };\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, position);\n\n    Primitives.DrawSphere();\n}\nGL.PopMatrix();\n// Only affect sphere\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light1);\nBecause the model-view matrix effects the light at the time that we set the lights position, and we set the lights position AFTER the model matrix of the sphere has been applied, this light will move with the sphere.  So if you move the sphere, (by changing GL.Translate(2.5f, 1.0f, -0.5f);), the light will move with it! This is what your scene should look like:\n\nThat&#39;s the basic implementation of a local light. Let&#39;s try getting a bit more fancy with it by actually orbiting the light around the sphere! First things first, let&#39;s add a new variable for the angle of the light orbit to the class:\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class LocalLightSample : Game{\n        Grid grid = null;\n        Vector3 cameraAngle = new Vector3(0.0f, -25.0f, 10.0f);\n        float lightAngle = 0.0f;\nIn update, we&#39;re going to rotate this light faster than the camera:\npublic override void Update(float dTime) {\n    cameraAngle.X += 30.0f * dTime;\n    lightAngle += 90.0f * dTime;\n}\nNow rendering gets a bit tricky. We could do something crazy and figure out how to configure the positon of the light based on the light angle, but that involves a bunch of math that we don&#39;t really need to do. Instead, we can simply move the modelview matrix into the position that we want to render the light at, render the light at (0,0,0) relative to the modelview matrix, then restore the modelview matrix before rendering the sphere.\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light1);\nGL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.PushMatrix();\n{\n    // Apply the sphere translation\n    GL.Translate(2.5f, 1.0f, -0.5f\n\n    // Move the light into place\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n    {\n        // Orbit the light around the y axis\n        GL.Rotate(lightAngle, 0f, 1f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Translate(-2f, 0f, -2f);\n\n        // Render light where the model-view matrix is. No translation.\n        position = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\n        GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, position);\n    }\n    // Get rid of the light transform, restore the sphere translation\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    Primitives.DrawSphere();\n}\nGL.PopMatrix();\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light1);\nThat works, you application now looks the same, but the light is moving around. Take note of what happens when the blue light passes over a section of the sphere that&#39;s lit yellow. The geometry turns white! Why is that? Doesn&#39;t blue + yellow = green?\n\nIn the real world, that would be the case, but computers approximate color with RGB values. The sphere is it yellow, which is RGB(1, 1, 0), then a blue light passes over, blue is RGB(0, 0, 1). What happens when you combine (add) the two vectors RGB(1, 1, 0) + RGB(0, 0, 1), the result equals RGB(1, 1, 1), which is white. This is a really good example of where computer graphics fall short, by approximating colors into RGB channels we loose some of the properties that real world colors have.\nThe scene looks great, it&#39;s almost where we want to to be, but it&#39;s really hard to tell where the blue light is. I mean, it&#39;s easy to see it&#39;s effect on the sphere, but it&#39;s hard to tell where the actual light is. Let&#39;s fix that. We can visualize the blue light by rendering a small, unlit blue sphere at the lights position. This should be easy, since we already have the modelview matrix configured with the lights model matrix.\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light1);\nGL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\nGL.PushMatrix();\n{\n    GL.Translate(2.5f, 1.0f, -0.5f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n    {\n        GL.Rotate(lightAngle, 0f, 1f, 0.0f);\n        GL.Translate(-2f, 0f, -2f);\n\n        position = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\n        GL.Light(LightName.Light1, LightParameter.Position, position);\n\n        // Disable lighting, we want the visualization sphere to be a solid color\n        GL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n        // We want the visual light sphere to be small\n        GL.Scale(0.25f, 0.25f, 0.25f);\n        // And blue\n        GL.Color3(0f, 0f, 1f);\n        // Draw the light visualization\n        Primitives.DrawSphere();\n        // Re-enable lighting for the rest of the scene\n        GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    }\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n    // This is still what draws the sphere\n    Primitives.DrawSphere();\n}\nGL.PopMatrix();\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Light1);\nNow it&#39;s easy to tell where the blue light is. The scene looks like this:\n\nDetails\nThere is one last modification i want to make to the above scene. Right now the lighting on the sphere looks kind of bad. That&#39;s because the sphere is made up of a small number of triangles. Remember, lighting is done on a per vertex basis, the further the vertices of a triangle are (that is, the larger a triangle is), the more the lighting has to interpolate. Interpolating essentially kills attenuation and causes the artifacts we see on screen. We can fix this by adding more triangles to the sphere. Change the draw call of the sphere (the one that is rendered, not the light preview) to sub-divide 5 times.\nPrimitives.DrawSphere(5);\nThe resulting scene now has much more accurate lighting for the sphere\n\n"},"Chapter5/spot.html":{"url":"Chapter5/spot.html","title":"Spot Light","body":"Spot Light\nThe spot light is probably the least used of the three light types OpenGL provides. Why is that? Well, the attenuation calculation for a spot light is the same as that of a point light, but in addition to that OpenGL needs to do math to only light a cone, not a sphere. Limiting the light to a cone shape makes spot lights considerably more expensive than point lights. So much so, that things a spot light would be perfect for like street lamps are most often implemented with point lights instead.\nSo, if spot lights are more expensive, and point light generally have the same look to them, is there a reason to know about spot lights? Or even to implement them? Yes there is. Sometimes using a PointLight will not suffice. If the shape of the light matters, a spot light is the only way to go. Like luigis manor:\n\nWe&#39;re going to go trough implementing a simple spot light together. All the advanced lighting topics (local lights, moving lights, etc...) have been covered in the Directional Light and Point Light sections. So this section should be pretty short.\nImplementation\nLets start with the unlit test scene we set up in the begenning. \nEnable lighting and light 0. Configure light 0 to have a diffuse term of yellow, an ambient term of black and a specular term of white.\nSet the position of this light to  (0, 3, 3, 1). Unlike the colors, you can&#39;t configure the lights position in the Initialize function. Just like a Point Light, a Spot light must be defined in eye space. Therefore you have to set it after the view matrix is set.\nYour scene should be lit like this (once you let it rotate a bit):\n\nSet your grid subdivision to as high as you can while still maintaining a smooth framerate. For me this is 8. At a subdivision level of 8 my game rotates smoothly, at 9 the frame gets super laggy. At 10 my scene moves maybe two seconds every frame and my graphics card catches fire.\nNext, let&#39;s set the properties that make up a spot light, these are SpotCutoff, SpotExponent and SpotDirection. For an review of how these work, check the &quot;Spotlights&quot; section of &quot;Light Sources&quot;, because they have already been covered there i&#39;m not going to cover them here. We&#39;re just going to use them.\nYou can set these properties in the Initialize function, as they don&#39;t change frame to frame. We&#39;re going to set a cutoff of 15, an exponent of 5 and a direction of  (0, -1, 0):\nfloat[] direction = { 0f, -1f, 0f };\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.SpotCutoff, 15f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.SpotExponent, 5f);\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.SpotDirection, direction);\nIf you run your game and let it rotate you should see the below image. If your whole scene is black that means your grid&#39;s vertices are all outside of the spot lights reach, it needs to be sub-divided more. (You need a minimum of 4. At subdiv level 4 you will see a light blob). The below image is with subdivision level 8.\n\nCleanup\nThat&#39;s it. The above code is really all there is to spot lights! Let&#39;s do a few quick cleanup steps to pull this demo together.\nFirst and foremost, it always helps to be able to visualize where a light is. To do this, we&#39;re going to render a small sphere at the position of the light, and a line in its direction. If you&#39;re feeling brave try to implement the code without looking at the below example.\nRender the visualization geometry for the light after the grid is rendered:\n public override void Render() {\n    // ... Set eye position, configure look at matrix\n\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, pos);\n\n    grid.Render(8);\n\n    GL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n    {\n        GL.Translate(pos[0], pos[1], pos[2]);\n        GL.Scale(0.25f, 0.25f, 0.25f);\n        GL.Color3(1f, 1f, 0f);\n        Primitives.DrawSphere();\n\n        GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Lines);\n\n        GL.Vertex3(0f, 0f, 0f);\n        // direction for me = new float[] {0, -1, 0};\n        Vector3 lightDirection = new Vector3(direction[0], direction[1], direction[2]);\n        lightDirection.Normalize();\n        GL.Vertex3(lightDirection[0] * 5.0f, lightDirection[1] * 5f, lightDirection[2] * 5f);\n\n        GL.End();\n    }\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n\n    // ... Rest of code is unchanged\nWith the light visualization code in place, your scene should look like this:\n\nAnd finally, let&#39;s tilt the light so it actually lighs up some geometry other than the floor! Change the direction fo the light from (0, -1, 0) to (-2, -1, -3). The scene after rotating a bit will look like this:\n\nThere are a few artifacts left in here. For example, once the scene rotates enough the light visualizers direction points in a different direction than the light. Or when the light hits the edge of the ground plane, the grid indicators get lit (because the grid vertex will now fall into a light). \nThe above issues are expected, we&#39;re going to acknowledge that they exist, but it&#39;s not worth spending time to fix them.\n"},"Chapter5/materials.html":{"url":"Chapter5/materials.html","title":"Materials","body":"Materials\nLights account for only half of the properties of what we see. The other half is materials. So far every object we&#39;ve lit has been treated as a mostly white object. Reflecting light almost perfectly. But the real world doesn&#39;t work like that. Red light on a blue object might make that object look blue. Some objects are shiny, while other objects are matte. Objects can be assigned these properties trough materials.\nOpenGL approximates material properties based on the way the material reflects red, green and blue light. For instance, if you have a surface that is green, it will reflect all incomming green light, absorbing all blue and red light. If you where to place this surface under a purple light, it would appear black. This is because the surface only reflects green light. It absorbs the red and blue components of the purple light, there is no green light left to reflect. \nIf you where to place a green surface under a white light, it would still look green. This is because white is a combination of all colors. The surface will absorb the red and blue components of the light, and reflect the green.\nFinally, placing this surface under a green light, it would still look green. There is no color for the surface to absorb, and all incomming green is reflected back at the viewer. It would look exactly the same as if we had placed the surface under a white light.\nMaterials have the same color terms as lights: ambient, diffuse and specular. These three properties combined will determine how much light a material reflects. A material with high ambient, low diffuse and low specular will reflect only ambient light sources while absorbing light from diffuse and specular sources. \nA material with hight specular reflectance will appear shiny, even when absorbing the ambient and diffuse light sources. The values defined for the ambient &amp; diffuse reflectances (terms) of a material will determine the color of the material. They are usually the same. \nTo make sure that the specular highlights end up being the same color as the light being shined, the specular reflectance (term) is usually set to white or gray. A good way to think about this is a bright white light shining on a blue marble. While the marble is blue the reflected specular highlight remains white.\n"},"Chapter5/defmat.html":{"url":"Chapter5/defmat.html","title":"Defining Materials","body":"Defining materials\nNow that you have a general understanding of what materials are, lets look at how to use them. Materials do not need to be enabled or anything, the truth is you have been using them all along, just with whatever the default values where. Now, we&#39;re going to set some non-default values.\nActually, setting a material is fairly similar to creating a light source. The main difference is the name of the functions being used:\nvoid GL.Material(MaterialFace face, MaterialParameter param, float value);\nvoid GL.Material(MaterialFace face, MaterialParameter param, float[] value);\nThe face paramater in these functions specifies how the material will be applied to the objects polygons, implying that materials can affect the front and back faces of polygons differently. It can be one of three values:\n\nFront\nBack\nFrontAndBack\n\nOnly the faces you specify will be modified by the call to GL.Material. Most often you will use the same values for front and back faces (and 90% of the time back faces will be culled, so the back face value won&#39;t matter). The second paramater param tells OpenGL which material property we are assiging a value to. This can be any of the following:\n\nAmbient Ambient color of the material\nDiffuse Diffuse color of the material\nAmbientAndDiffuse Ambient AND diffuse color of material\nSpecular Specular color of material\nShininess Specular exponent (power)\nEmission Emissive color\n\nMaterial Colors\nThe ambient, diffuse and specular components specify how a material interacts with a light source and, thus determine he color of the material. These values are set by passing Ambient, Diffuse or AmbientAnddiffuse to GL.Material as the MaterialParamater. Most often the same values are used for both the ambient and diffuse term, so much so that OpenGL provided a conveniance paramater AmbientAndDiffuse so you can specify both with 1 function call.\nFor example, if you wanted to set the ambient material color to red for the front and back of polygons, you would call this function:\nfloat[] red = { 1f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, red);\nSimilarly, to set both the ambient and diffuse paramaters to blue would be:\nfloat[] blue = { 0f, 0f, 1f, 1f };\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, blue);\nKeep in mind that any polygons you draw after calling GL.Material will be affected by the material settings until the next call to GL.Material\nShinines\nTry looking at something metallic and something cloth under a direct light. You&#39;ll notice that the metalic obejct appears to be shiny, while the clothisn&#39;t. This is because the light striking the cloth object is mostly scattered by the rough cloth surface, whereas light is reflecting directly on the smooth metal surface.\n This image demonstrates the effects of different Specular material colors and Shininess specular exponent values. \n\nLeft: Zero-intensity (0., 0., 0., 1.) specular material color\nspecular exponent is irrelevant. \n\n\nCenter: Low-intensity (.3, .3, .3, 1.) specular material color\nwith a specular exponent of 10.0. \n\n\nRight: Full-intensity (1., 1., 1., 1.) specular material color\nwith a specular exponent of 128.0.\n\n\n\n\nThe sphere on the right looks like metal. The illusion of shininess is caused by the bright spot, known as a specular highlight. The sphere on the left is a more cloth-like material (t-shirt maybe), and therefore looks more dull. The middle sphere gives the look of most plastics.\nThe shininess of a material is simulated by the size of the specular highlight. This is controlled with a SINGLE scalar value, which you set with the MaterialParameter.Shininess paramater. This value can range from 0 to 128 (NOT 0 to 1), with 128 representing an extremly shiny material and 0 representing a non shiny mateiral. \nYou would make an object metalic like this:\nGL.MaterialMaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 128);\nEmissive materials\nThe emissive property of a material allow you to cheaply simulate an object that emits light (thing TRON or maybe a glow in the dark toy). It&#39;s important to note that the objects dont&#39; really emit light. That is, they will not light or affect nearby objects.\nThe emissive term is simply added to the objects other lighting components to make the object appear brighter than notmal. Here is an example of setting a dark light emission\nfloat[] emissiveColor  = { .3f, .3f, .3f, 1f };\nGL.MaterialMaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Emission, emissiveColor);\nBy default the emissive term is (0, 0, 0, 1), which means it has no contribution and is therefor effectivley turned off.\nColor Tracking\nNote, color tracking is not an official term. You will probably not hear it used outside the context of this book. But it&#39;s an easy way to describe setting the material color with a call to GL.Color.\nColor Tracking allows you to set the color of a material with calls to GL.Color instead of using GL.Material, which often leads to smaller, more easy to read code. You can enable color tracking with the following call:\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.ColorMaterial);\nAfter enabling color tracking you use the GL.ColorMaterial function to specify which material paramaters will by affected by future calls to GL.Color. The signature of this function is:\nvoid GL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace face, ColorMaterialParameter param);\nLike always, the face can be set to Front, Back or FrontAndBack. The mode paramater can be:\n\nAmbient\nDiffuse\nSpecular\nAmbientAndDiffuse\nEmssion\n\nMost often you will be using the default values of this function (so you might not even have to call it). The default values are FrontAndBack, AmbientAndDiffuse. Lets look at some sample code that uses color tracking to set the diffuse color of an objects material:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\nGL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.Diffuse);\nGL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f);\nPrimitives.DrawSphere();\nAs you can see, color tracking is very simple to set up and use. I almost never use it, i think giving multiple utilities to the same function is a bad idea. I like to explicitly type Material when i&#39;m setting a material color component.\n"},"Chapter5/shade_test.html":{"url":"Chapter5/shade_test.html","title":"Test Scene","body":"Test scene\nLets go ahead and set up a test scene.

Get the code in it up to par with the test scene.\nOnce you have that, we&#39;re just going to play around with material colors. Take note, when setting the color components, OpenGL expects a 4 component (RGBA) array of floating point values (0.0f to 1.0f)\nFirst, lets set the following materials\n\nSphere 1\nSet the material ambient to white\nSet the material diffuse to black\n\n\nSphere 2\nSet the material ambient to black\nSet the material diffuse to white\n\n\nSphere 3\nSet the material ambient to white\nSet the material diffuse to white\n\n\n\nTry setting the material paramaters yourself first. The code for how to do it is given below the image, but you should be able to set these without the sample code. The scene will look like this:\n\nThe code to set the material color paramaters, looks like this:\n// Set up camera\n// Render unlit grid\n\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { 0, 0, 0, 1 });\n// Render first sphere\n\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, new float[] { 0, 0, 0, 1 });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\n// Render secong sphere\n\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\n// Render third sphere\nLike we discussed earlyer, the materials ambient property determines how much of the lights ambient property effects the object. Same for all other properties. When this is set to white, it means the lights ambient fully effects the object, when it&#39;s set to black it means the ambient does not affect the object at all.\nA few important observations can be made from this code. Notice that the sphere only affected by ambient lighting isn&#39;t shaded. It&#39;s solid. That&#39;s because ambient light is constant, it doesn&#39;t really have a source! Notice, the diffuse lighting IS shaded. This is because the diffuse is the directional component of the light.\nLastly, take a look at the third sphere. We have both ambient and diffuse lights effecting this, but it looks AWEFUL! Shouldn&#39;t it look like the default lit sphere? No, not exactly. By default the lighting model sets the following values\n\nAmbient - (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0)\nDiffuse - (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0)\n\nThe two values when added to come out to (1, 1, 1, 1). This is purley coincidental, not a requirement! Go ahead, update the render code for that last sphere to reflect these numbers. All of a sudden the scene looks like this:\n\nThe material code was changed to:\n// Set up camera\n// Render unlit grid\n\n// Render first sphere\n// Render secong sphere\n\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, new float[] { 0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1 });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { 0.8f, 0.8f, 0.8f, 1 });\n// Render third sphere\nNow that third sphere looks the same as it did in the test scene. You can really see how the shading works. To get the final color of this sphere. Let&#39;s walk trough how this color was obtained.\nFirst we take the ambient component of the light (1, 0, 0) and multiply it with the ambient component of the material (0.2, 0.2, 0.2). The result is the objects ambient component (0.2, 0, 0). \nNext we take the diffuse component of the light (1, 0, 1) and multiply it with the diffuse component of the material (0.8, 0.8, 0.8). The result is the objects diffuse component (0, 0, 0.8)\nFinally, to get the color of the object, we add the ambient and diffuse components of the object together, resulting in (0.2, 0, 0.8). The color interpolation (dark on bottom, light on top) is contributed by the diffuse component.\nPlay around with the colors a bit. See if you can predict what your code will look like once its on screen.\n"},"Chapter5/mat_shine.html":{"url":"Chapter5/mat_shine.html","title":"Specular","body":"Specular\nThe ambient and diffuse components of the material define the overall color of the object. The specular component defines how shiny the object is.\nLet&#39;s make a new demo class we&#39;ll call it MateiralSpecular. Get the code in it up to par with the test scene.\nWhen setting the Ambient and Diffuse colors, OpenGL expected a floating point array. Setting the specular is a two part process. You must set the color (RGBA array) and the power (single float, ranging from 0 to 128).\nQuick recap, you set the specular color with:\nGL.Material(MaterialFace, MaterialParameter.Specular, float[]);\nAnd the specular power with:\nGL.Material(MaterialFace, MaterialParameter.Shininess, float);\nSimple Specular\n\nSphere 1\nSet ambient and diffuse to default values\nSet specular color to white\nSet specular power to 0\n\n\nSphere 2\nSet ambient and diffuse to default values\nSet specular color to white\nSet specular power to 16\n\n\nSphere 3\nSet ambient and diffuse to default values\nSet specular color to white\nSet specular power to 128\n\n\n\nIf you set up the properties correctly, your scene should look like this:\n\nTo get to that, i set the above material components like so:\n// Setup camera\n// Render unlit grid\n\n// Set ambient and diffuse\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 } );\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 0.0f);\n// Draw sphere 1\n\n// Set ambient and diffuse\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 } );\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 16.0f);\n// Draw sphere 2\n\n// Set ambient and diffuse\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 } );\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 128.0f);\n// Draw sphere 3\nThe sphere with a specular power of 0 is all white. That&#39;s because with a low specular power, the specular component dominates the object&#39;s color.\nThe sphere with a specular power of 16 looks like it&#39;s lit strongly, the light is dispursing on it evenly.\nThe sphere with a specular power of 128 looks like a real hard light is shining on it, as the light reflection is super tiny.\nThe lower your specular power, the larger the specular color will be accross the surface of your object.\nSpecular color\nSpecular color works much like ambient and diffuse. First we take the specular color of the light (1, 1, 1, 1), and multiply it with the specular component of the material (1, 1, 1, 1). In our example, the object specular color is white. \nThis object specular color is then added to the object&#39;s ambient and diffuse colors. The result is (0.2, 0, 0) + (0, 0, 0.8) + (1, 1, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1). Notice, the color is capped to 1. This is why the spheres reflect the light as white.\nThe ammount of surface area that is shaded by the specular color is determined by the specular power (shininess). The higher the power, the less of the surface area is shaded.\nLet&#39;s have some fun, and try to reflect a different color! Where you set up the light, currently it&#39;s specular color is wite. Set the lights specular color to green!\n\n\nKeep the specular color of the light green\nSet the specular power for all the spheres to 16. \nSet the specular color of the first sphere&#39;s material to black\nSet the specular color of the second sphere&#39;s material to (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)\nSet the specular color of the third sphere&#39;s material to white\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\nBy reducing the amount of specular color a sphere takes to 0.5, we dulled out the specular highlight. This makes the middle sphere look more rough, like a plastic as opposed to the first sphere which looks metal.\nThe last spehere has no specular contribution. This is because the specular color of the light (0, 1, 0) multiplied with the specular component of the material (0, 0, 0) results it black (0, 0, 0). This means it does not effect the lighting.\n"},"Chapter5/ctrack.html":{"url":"Chapter5/ctrack.html","title":"Color Tracking","body":"Color Tracking\nWe call it color tracking, but more often than not people simply refer to this technique as Changing material paramaters with GL.Color, sometimes it&#39;s also refered to as color material mode\nEarlyer we saw that OpenGL uses the current material color (set with GL.Material) when lighting is enabled, but uses the current primary color (set with GL.Color) when lighting is disabled. This inconsistency can often get confusing. It&#39;s also slightly more expensive to call GL.Material than it is to call GL.Color because of the safety checks the functions do. Whenever you change a materials color, most often you only change the diffuse and ambient components.\ncolor mateiral mode adresses these issues. When you enable color material mode, certain current material colors track the current primary color instead. To use color materials, you must first enable them:\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.ColorMaterial);\nThis will cause calls to GL.Color to change not only the primary color, but also the current ambient and diffuse material colors. Of course you can change which properties color tracking affects by calling GL.ColorMaterial.\nWe&#39;ve already discussed how to change which color is tracked in the Defining Materials section.\nExample 1\nLets make a new demo scene, call it ColorTrackingDemo and get it up to par with the test scene. Once you have that:\n\nIn the initialize function\nCall GL.Mateiral to:\nSet the specular component to white\nSet the shininess to 20\n\n\nEnable color material\nSet color materials to track the ambeint AND diffuse components for front and back face\n\n\nIn the render function\nSet the first spheres render color to red\nSet the second spheres render color to green\nSet the third spheres color to blue\n\n\n\nYour scene should look like the below image:\n\nIn case your scene doesn&#39;t look like that, here is the code i used to get that result\n public override void Initialize() {\n    base.Initialize();\n\n    // Enable lighting and configure light 0\n\n    GL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\n    GL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 20.0f);\n\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\n    GL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.AmbientAndDiffuse);\n}\n\npublic override void Render() {\n    // Set up view matrix\n\n    // Render unlit grid\n\n    GL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f);\n    // Draw first sphere\n\n    GL.Color3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    // Draw second sphere\n\n    GL.Color3(0f, 0f, 1f);\n    Draw third sphere\n}\nThe most important thing to note here is the shading. Because of the way the shading model works, the blue sphere gets a lot of diffuse light, the other two get too much ambient. Let&#39;s fix that!\nExample 2\nUsing Example 1 as our starting point.\n\nIn initialize\nChange the color material tracking point to diffuse\nSet the materials default ambient to { .2f, .2f, .2f, 1f }\n\n\n\n\nHere is the code change\n// This is new\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, new float[] { .2f, .2f, .2f, 1f });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 20.0f);\n\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\n// This changed\nGL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.Diffuse);\nThis still doesn&#39;t look great. All the spheres now take a uniform ambient term, but only the blue sphere has a blue term to take for it&#39;s diffuse! That&#39;s why the other two look red-ish.\nExample 3\nThe key to good material usage is to think about color a little differently! Instead of thinking about a light having a color and a material having a color, think of the light as an overall brightness (always have a white light), and the mateiral as the color.\nWe&#39;re going to be using example 1 (not example 2!) as a starting point. That is, the color material is going to track both the ambient and diffuse terms. The sphere colors are set with GL.Color3, they are: red, green and blue. This is the starting point.\nNow, change the LIGHT (not material) ambient color to { 0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f } and the LIGHT (not mateiral) diffuse color to {0.8f, 0.8f, 0.8f, 1.0f }. Run the game and your scene looks the way one would expecte it:\n\nOnly the initialize function changed from example 1, here it is in its entirety:\npublic override void Initialize() {\nbase.Initialize();\n\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n\nfloat[] red = new float[] { 1, 0, 0, 1 };\nfloat[] blue = new float[] { 0, 0, 1, 1 };\nfloat[] white = new float[] {0, 1, 0, 1 };\n\n// We changed the LIGHT! Not the Material\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0, 1, 1, 0});\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, new float[] { .2f, .2f, .2f, 1f });\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { .8f, .8f, .8f, 1f } );\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, white);\n\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1, 1, 1, 1 });\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 20.0f);\n\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\nGL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.AmbientAndDiffuse);\n}\nThis works because the light now defines how strong the ambient and diffuse components are. The actual material defines the color. Because if the material diffuse is blue (0, 0, 1) and the light diffuse is (.8, .8, .8) then the two multiplied together create the objects diffuse (0, 0, .8).\nThis (example 3) is the configuration i do 90% of my lighting with! It&#39;s something you should be comfotrable setting up.\n"},"Chapter5/norms.html":{"url":"Chapter5/norms.html","title":"Normals","body":"Normals\nWe&#39;ve already discussed normal vectors a litle bit as a mathematical concept, but seeing how normals are the key to realistic lighting, they warrant further discussion.\nNormals in terms of lighting are vectors that are perpendicular to a surface, and have  a lenght of 1.\n\nThey are pivotal to lighting because normals are used to describe the orientation of a surface. When you specify a light you either specify it at a point in space, or at some direction. When you draw an object, light rays from the light source will strike the surface at some angle. The color of a surface is calculated using the angle that the ray hit the surface with and the normal of the surface.\nThe actual math behind how the normal is used to calculate a surface color is pretty involved, we will cover it, but much later.\nIn OpenGL normals are defined per vertex. This allows us a great deal of flexibility in making an object look smooth or sharp. Take the following cube for example, there are two ways to possibly define it&#39;s normals:\n\nMethod A) is soft shaded, method B) is flat shaded. This is what they would look like lit:\n\nNotice, soft shading does not really have defined edges. Flat shading does. You generally want to use flat shading for things like houses, and soft shading for organic things like poeple.\nIf you want to use normals in lighting, every time a vertex is specified, a normal must also be give. You can specify a normal with the function:\nvoid GL.Normal3(float, float, float);\nThe function works the same as GL.Vertex3. The values you pass to it represent a 3 dimensional vector. This vector MUST BE NORMALIZED, or your lighting results will be wrong. This is how you could specify a triangle:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(-3f, 0f, 2f);\n\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(2f, 0f, 0f);\n\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(-1f, 0f, -3f);\nGL.End();\nNotice how every vertex has a normal. Because of the way the OpenGL state machine works, you could simply specify one normal, and all subsequent vertices would use it. That it, this code is valid:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(-3f, 0f, 2f);\n    GL.Vertex3(2f, 0f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(-1f, 0f, -3f);\nGL.End();\nBut that becomes hard to manage later on. I encourage you to specify a normal for ever vertex, even if it&#39;s a duplicate. You can take a look at the static Primitives class we use to draw primitives. It draws all primitives WITH normals.\nCalculating normals\nFinding the normal of a flat surface is easy, given a little vector math, in particular the cross product. You might remember, given two 3D vectors A and B, the cross product will produce a vector that is perpendicular to both A and B.\nCheck your math code for implementation details.\nThis means, that you need two vectors, A and B to calculate the normal of a surface. Where can you find these vectors? All triangles are made up of 3 points: P1, P2 and P3. You can use them to find the vectors. Here is a visual example:\n\nSo, the full code to get the normal of a triangle would look like this:\nVector3 GetNormal(Triangle tri) {\n    Vector3 v1 = tri.p2 - tri.p1;\n    Vector3 v2 = tri.p3 - tri.p1;\n\n    Vector3 cross = Vector3.CrossProduct(v1, v2);\n    Vector2 norm = Vector3.Normalize(cross);\n\n    return norm;\n}\nRemember, the cross product just returns a perpendicular vector. You still have to normalize it!\nOpenGL Normalization\nYou can ask OpenGL to do the normalization for you, so you can pass non-normal vectors into the GL.Normal3 function. To do so, you just have to enable Normalization:\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.Normalize);\nHowever, i strongly discourage doing this. It is viewed as bad practice, asking OpenGL to normalize is actually a lot slower than just doing the normalization your self.\n"},"Chapter5/the_lighting_model.html":{"url":"Chapter5/the_lighting_model.html","title":"The Lighting Model","body":"The lighting model\nIn addition to individual lights and materials, and normals there are additional global components of the lighting model that determine the final color of rendered objects. These are:\n\nA global ambient term\nWeather the location of the viewer is local or infinite\nThis only effects the specular highlight\n\n\nWeather the lighting is one or two sided\nWeather the calulated specular color is stored seperately from other color values\nMeaning it&#39;s passed as it&#39;s own color to the final rendering stage\n\n\n\nYou control these elements of the lighting model with the GL.LightModel function, which is defined as:\nvoid GL.LightModel(LightModelParameter, float);\nvoid GL.LightModel(LightModelParameter, float[]);\nThe first paramater specifies which property you are modifying, the second is the value you are setting it to. The argument will either be a single float, or a 4 component array. The values for the first argument are:\n\nLightModelAmbient Ambient intensity of the scene (RGBA)\nThe default value is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0) \n\n\nLightModelLovalViewer Is the viewpoint local or infinite. \nThe default value is 0 (INFINITE).\nThis takes either 1 (LOCAL) or 0 (INFINITE) as arguments \n\n\nLightModelTwoSide One or two sided lighting. \nDefault is 0 (ONE-SIDED)\nThis can be either 0 (ONE-SIDED) or 1 (TWO-SIDED) \n\n\nLightModelColorControl Is the specular color stored seperate or together with ambient and diffuse\nDefault value is 0 (Single color, not sperate)\n0 is single, 1 is seperate\n\n\n\nWe will discuss each of these properties below, however they are not important enough to each get their own coding section. So pay attention, this is the only page they will be mentioned on. \nOf course if you want to play around with them and make some practice scenes on your own, you can certainly do so.\nGlobal ambient light\nIn addition to the ambient light contributed by individual light sources, there is a global ambient light that is present wheater or not any light sources are enabled. This is used to model lights for which the source can not be determined. \nThis value is controlled with LightModelAmbient. The following code sets the global ambient light to a blue-green color. Kind of like what you might expect to see under water.\nfloat[] ambient = new float[] { 0f, 0.2f, 0.3f, 1f };\nGL.LightModel(LightModelParamater.LightModelAmbient, ambient);\nNote: I don&#39;t really like a magical light source that i can&#39;t see, more often than not i will straight up set this to black to avoid it from contributing to my scene.\nLocal or Infinite View\nWhen calculating the specular term, the direction from the vertex being calculated to the viewpoint effects the intensity of the specular highlight. The LightModelLocalViewer paramater lets you specify weather a viewpoint is local (based on the viewers actual world position) or an infinite distance away.\nHaving a local viewpoint will look more realistic, but will be significantly more expensive calculation wise, as OpenGL will now need to calculate the direction for each vertex. An infinite view is used by default, it looks good enough 90% of the time.\nIf the default isn&#39;t realistic enough for your application, you can change it any time with:\n// This takes an int (or float), \n// 1 is ON \n// 0 is OFF\nGL.LightModel(LightModelParamater.LightModelLocalViewer, 1);\nTwo Sided or One Sided Lighting\nThe next paramater you can specify is LightModelTwoSide. This paramater deals with weather you want to calculate the ighting for the back of polygons correctly. For example, if you where to take an enclosed object, like a cube and cut it in half the inside would not be lit correctly. To light the inside correctly, you must enable two sided lighting like so:\n// 0 or 1\nGL.LightModel(LightModelParamater.LightModelTwoSide, 1);\nBecause most of the time you will not see inside closed meshes, and you will not see the back side of visible meshes, keeping this off is a good idea. It&#39;s off by default to save on performance.\nSeperate Specular Color\nThe final light model property you can set is the LightModelColorControl property. This control was added because when you do lighting with texturing the specular highlight tends to get washed out once the texture is applied. \nWhen you enable this property, OpenGL stores two colors per vertex. One that is a combination of the ambient, diffuse, and emissive light combined with the texture of the object. And one that is it&#39;s specular value. At render time it applies the specular value, this keeps the specular highlight from getting washed out by the texture colors.\nEnabling this property is pretty straight forward:\n// 0 or 1\nGL.LightModel(LightModelParamater.LightModelColorControl, 1);\nBecause i&#39;ve never rendered anything where the specular highlight REALLY mattered, i&#39;ve never had a need to turn this component on\n"},"Chapter5/color.html":{"url":"Chapter5/color.html","title":"Lighting Review","body":"Where render color comes from\nThis page is a straight up rip of Steve Baker&#39;s OpenGL Lighting tutorial. Some of this stuff we&#39;ve already covered and will serve as a review, other information might be brand new. Think of this as a one page cheat-sheet for lighting.\nIntroduction\nMany people starting out with OpenGL are confused by the way that OpenGL&#39;s built-in lighting works - and consequently how color functions. I hope to be able to clear up some of the confusion. What is needed to explain this clearly is a flow chart:\n\nLighting ENABLED or DISABLED?\nThe first - and most basic - decision is whether to enable lighting or not.\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.Lighting);\n...or...\nGL.Disable (EnableCaps.Lighting);\nIf it&#39;s disabled then all polygons, lines and points will be colored according to the setting of the various forms of the GL.Color command. Those colors will be carried forward without any change other than is imparted by texture or fog if those are also enabled. Hence:\nGL.Color3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f) ;\n...gets you a pure red triangle no matter how it is positioned relative to the light source(s).\nWith EnableCaps.Lighting enabled, we need to specify more about the surface than just it&#39;s color - we also need to know how shiny it is, whether it glows in the dark and whether it scatters light uniformly or in a more directional manner.\nThe idea is that OpenGL switches over to using the current settings of the current &quot;material&quot; instead of the simplistic idea of a polygon &quot;color&quot;. This is an over-simplistic explanation - but keep it firmly in mind.\nglMaterial and glLight\nThe OpenGL light model presumes that the light that reaches your eye from the polygon surface arrives by four different mechanisms:\n\nAMBIENT - light that comes from all directions equally and is scattered in all directions equally by the polygons in your scene. This isn&#39;t quite true of the real world - but it&#39;s a good first approximation for light that comes pretty much uniformly from the sky and arrives onto a surface by bouncing off so many other surfaces that it might as well be uniform.\nDIFFUSE - light that comes from a particular point source (like the Sun) and hits surfaces with an intensity that depends on whether they face towards the light or away from it. However, once the light radiates from the surface, it does so equally in all directions. It is diffuse lighting that best defines the shape of 3D objects.\nSPECULAR - as with diffuse lighting, the light comes from a point souce, but with specular lighting, it is reflected more in the manner of a mirror where most of the light bounces off in a particular direction defined by the surface shape. Specular lighting is what produces the shiny highlights and helps us to distinguish between flat, dull surfaces such as plaster and shiny surfaces like polished plastics and metals.\nEMISSION - in this case, the light is actually emitted by the polygon - equally in all directions.\n\nSo, there are three light colors for each light - Ambient, Diffuse and Specular (set with GL.Light) and four for each surface (set with GL.Material). All OpenGL implementations support at least eight light sources - and the GL.Material can be changed at will for each polygon.\nThe final polygon color is the sum of all four light components, each of which is formed by multiplying the GL.Mateiral color by the GL.Light color (modified by the directionality in the case of Diffuse and Specular). Since there is no Emission color for the GL.Light, that is added to the final color without modification.\nA good set of settings for a light source would be to set the Diffuse and Specular components to the color of the light source, and the Ambient to the same color - but at MUCH reduced intensity, 10% to 40% seems reasonable in most cases. So, a blue light might be configured like so:\nfloat[] blue = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 1f, 1f };\nfloat[] dimBlue = new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0.1f, 1f);\n\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, dimBlue );\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, blue );\nGL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, blue );\nFor the GL.Material, it&#39;s usual to set the Ambient and Diffuse colors to the natural color of the object and to put the Specular color to white. The emission color is generally black for objects that do not shine by their own light. So, a yellow object might have the following material:\nfloat[] red = { 1f, 0f, 0f, 1f };\nfloat[] white = { 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f }\nfloat[] black = { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f }\n\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Ambient, red);\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Diffuse, red);\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, white);\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Emission, black);\nBefore you can use an OpenGL light source, it must be positioned using the GL.Light command and enabled using GL.Enable(EnableCaps.LightN) where &#39;N&#39; is 0 through 7. There are additional commands to make light sources directional (like a spotlight or a flashlight) and to have it attenuate as a function of range from the light source.\nglColorMaterial\nThis is without doubt the most confusing thing about OpenGL lighting - and the biggest cause of problems for beginners.\nThe problem with using GL.Material to change polygon colors is two-fold:\n\nYou frequently need to change GL.Mateiral properties for both Ambient and Diffuse to identical values - this takes two OpenGL function calls which is annoying.\nYou cannot change GL.Mateiral settings with many of the more advanced polygon rendering techniques such as Vertex arrays and GL.DrawElements.\n\nFor these reasons, OpenGL has a feature that allows you do drive the GL.Material colors using the more flexible GL.Color command (which is not otherwise useful when lighting is enabled).\nTo drive (say) the Emission component of the GL.Material using GL.Color, you must say:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\nGL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.Emission);\nFrom this point performing a GL.Color command has the exact same effect as calling:\nGL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Emission, ...colors...);\nOne especially useful option is:\nGL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.AmbientAndDiffuse);\nThis causes GL.Color commands to change both Ambient and Diffuse colors at the same time. That&#39;s a very common thing to want to do for real-world lighting models.\nLight Sources.\nOpenGL&#39;s lights are turned on and off with GL.Enable(EnableCaps.LightN) and GL.Disable(EnableCaps.LightN) where &#39;N&#39; is a number in the range zero to the maximum number of lights that this implementation supports (typically eight). \nThe GL.Light call allows you to specify the color (ambient, diffuse and specular), position, direction, beam width and attenuation rate for each light. \nBy default, it is assumed that both the light and the viewer are effectively infinitely far from the object being lit. You can change that with the GL.LightModel call - but doing so is likely to slow down your program - so don&#39;t do it unless you have to. GL.LightModel also allows you to set a global ambient lighting level that&#39;s independent of the other OpenGL light sources.\nThere is also an option to light the front and back faces of your polygons differently. That is also likely to slow your program down - so don&#39;t do it.\nglNormal\nWhen lighting is enabled, OpenGL suddenly needs to know the orientation of the surface at each polygon vertex. You need to call GL.Normal for each vertex to define that - OpenGL does not provide a useful default.\nGood Settings.\nWith this huge range of options, it can be hard to pick sensible default values for these things. Even harder is to debug broken lighting! Sometimes you start a scene and everything is black. The best way to debug this is to set some sensible defaults, and work from there.\nMy advice for a starting point is to:\n\nSet EnableCaps.Light0&#39;s position to something like 45 degrees to the &quot;vertical&quot;. Coordinate (1,1,0) should work nicely in most cases.\nSet EnableCaps.Light0&#39;s Ambient color to 0,0,0,1\nSet EnableCaps.Light0&#39;s Diffuse color to 1,1,1,1\nSet EnableCaps.Light0&#39;s Specular color to 1,1,1,1\nSet the GL.LightModel&#39;s global ambient to 0.2,0.2,0.2,1 (this is the default).\nDon&#39;t set any other GL.Light or GL.LightModel options - just let them default.\nEnable Enable.Lighting and EnableCaps.Light0.\nEnable EnableCaps.ColorMaterial and set ColorMaterialParameter.ColorMaterial to ColorMaterialParameter.AmbientAndDiffuse. This means that GL.Material will control the polygon&#39;s specular and emission colours and the ambient and diffuse will both be set using GL.Color.\nSet the GL.Material&#39;s Specular color to 1,1,1,1\nSet the GL.Material&#39;s Emission color to 0,0,0,1\nSet the GL.Material to whatever color you want each polygon to basically appear to be. That sets the Ambient and Diffuse to the same value which is what you generally want.\n\nUsing Alpha with lighting enabled.\nOne confusing thing is that each of the color components (Ambient,Diffuse, Specular and Emission) has an associated &quot;alpha&quot; component for setting transparency. \nIt is important to know that only the DIFFUSE color&#39;s alpha value actually determines the transparency of the polygon. If you have taken my advice and used GL.ClolorMaterial to cause GL.Color to drive the ambient and diffuse components then this seems perfectly natural.\nBut people sometimes want to use the GL.Color to drive one of the other material components and are then very confused about their inability to set the transparency using GL.Color. If that happens to you - remember to use GL.Material to set the diffuse color - and hence the alpha for the polygon overall.\n"},"Chapter6/Introduction.html":{"url":"Chapter6/Introduction.html","title":"Blending and Fog","body":"Blending and Fog\nUp to this point we&#39;ve used RGBA for a lot of things. Every material color has an alpha component. Even lights have an alpha component! Yet, setting this to 0.5 does not add alpha to our scene at all.\nOpenGL let&#39;s you actually use the Alpha component to draw translusent and transparent primites trough a process known as blending. \nIn addition to blending, OpenGL also offers fog. Fog is great to fade objects in the distance out. If something is at the end of your view frustum, it&#39;s better to fade it out and make your world look like it&#39;s in a fog than it is to have a hard cut-off point that shows players that they are viewing the world trough a limited window.\nPerhaps the most famous use of fog is the original silent hill. The PS1 could not draw many triangles (weak processor). To avoid drawing too many triangles and loosing framerate, the developers had to set the camera frustums far plane pretty close to a distance of about 25 (compared to the 1000 we set ours to). \nThis short frustum caused objects farther than 25 game units to not render, making things like building pop in and out of view. To compensate for this, the developers added a heavy fog to the game to limit the players visibility. Really, it was just used to hide the fact that anything further than 25 units would pop out of existance.\nThey used this heavy fog to add an air of mistery to the game, and accidentally gave rise to modern horror games.\n\n"},"Chapter6/blending.html":{"url":"Chapter6/blending.html","title":"Blending","body":"Blending\nOpenGL allows you to blend incoming framents with pixels already on screen. Which enables you to introduce effects such as transparency into your scenes. With transparency you can simulate water, windows, glass and other objects in the world you can normally see trough.\nThe term fragment might be new to you, but it will come up several times from here on out. This is a good time to discuss what it is.\nAs OpenGL processes the primitives you pass to it, during the rasterization stage it breaks them down into pixel size chunks called fragments. Sometimes the terms pixel and fragment are used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference. A pixel is a value that gets written to the color buffer. A fragment is a piece of a primitive that might eventually become a pixel after it is depth-tested, alpha-tested, blended, combined with a texture,  combined with another fragment or it may just become a pixel without being modified.\nSo, essentially a fragment is data that can become a pixel, but isn&#39;t necesarley a pixel yet.\nRemember the alpha value we&#39;ve been ignoring all this time? Well, now that we&#39;re talking about blending it&#39;s time to learn how to use it. When enabling blending, you are telling OpenGL to combine the color of the incoming primitive with the color that is already in the frame buffer, and store that combined color back into the frame buffer.\nBlending operations are typically specified with the RGB values representing color, and the Alpha value representing opacity. But other combinations are possible. From now on,we will refer to the incomming fragment as SOURCE, and the pixel that is already in the frame buffer as DESTINATION.\nTo enable blending, call the GL.Enable method with EnableCaps.Blend as it&#39;s argument. Just enabling blending isn&#39;t enough to make blending happen. You must also tell OpenGL what formulat to use to blend pixel colors. You do this by defining a blending function for the source and destination fragments.\nYou can call the function GL.BlendFunc to define the source and destination blend factors. Blend factors are values in the 0 to 1 range, that are multiplied by the RGBA components of both the source and destination colors. The resulting colors are then combined (usually by adding them) and clamped to the range of 0 to 1. \nvoid GL.BlendFunc(BlendingFactorSrc sourceFactor, BlendingFactorDest destFactor);\nThe first argument is the source blend factor, the second argument is the destination blend factor. Both enums contain the same enumerated values, with the exception of OneMinusSrdColor which is only available as a source blend factor and OneMinusDstColor, which is only available as a destination blend factor. The enumerated values are:\n\nZero Each component is multiplied by 0, effectivley setting the color to black\nOne Each component is multiplied by 1, leaving the color unchanged\nSrcColor Each component is multiplied by the coresponding component\nOneMinusSrcColor Each component is multiplied by 1 - source color\nDstColor Each component is multiplied by the coresponding component in the destination color\nOneMinusDstColor Each component is multiplied by 1 - destination color\nSrcAlpha Each component is multiplied by the source alpha value\nOneMinusSrcAlpha Each component is multiplied by 1 - source alpha value\nDstAlpha Each component is multiplied by the destination alpha value\nOneMinusDstAlpha Each component is multiplied by 1 - dest alpha value\nConstantColor Each component is multiplied by a constant color, set using GL.BlendColor\nOneMinusConstantColor Each component is multiplied by 1 - constant color, set using GL.BlendColor\nConstantAlpha Each component is multiplied by an alpha value set using GL.BlendColor\nOneMinusConstantAlpha Each component is multiplied by 1 - a constant alpha value set using GL.BlendColor\nSrcAlphaSaturate Multiplies the source color by the minimum of source and (1 - destination). The  alpha value is not modified. Only valid as the source blend factor\n\nThe default values are One for the source and Zero for the destination. Which produces the same results as not using blending at all.\nMany different effects can be created with these blending factors, some o which are more useful in medical imaging than games. To better understand how this voodoo works, let&#39;s look at the application that is most often used in games: transparency! Typically transparency is implemented as follows:\nGL.Enable(EnableCaps.Blend)\nGL.BelndFunc(BlendingFactorSrc.SrcAlpha, BlendingFactorDest.OneMinusSrcAlpha);\nMemorize that function! It&#39;s the one you will use 90% of the time!\nTo get an idea of how this works, Let&#39;s examine how it would work for a single pixel. \n\nSay we drew a red triangle onto screen\nThe frame buffer has a red pixel \nDST: (1, 0, 0, 1)\n\n\nNext, we draw a blue triangle with 50% opacity \nSRC: (0, 0, 1, 0.5)\n\n\nWith the blend factors we&#39;ve chose, the source color is multiplied by the srouce alpha \n(0, 0, 1) * 0.5 = (0, 0, 0.5)\nSRC: (0, 0, 0.5, 0.5) \n\n\nThe destination will be multiplied by 1 - source alpha (0.5)\n(1, 0, 0) * (1 - 0.5) = (0.5, 0, 0)\nDST: (0.5, 0, 0, 1)\n\n\nFinally, the source and destination colors are added together. \nSRC + DST = (0, 0, 0.5) + (0.5, 0, 0)\nResult: ( 0.5, 0, 0.5)\n\n\nThis added number is written to the frame buffer\n(0.5, 0, 0.5) written to frame buffer\n\n\n\nThis simple example ignores one very important thing: you have to pay attention to the depth of the objects and the order in which they are rendered when using transperancy.\nWhen we draw without transperancy, the order of drawing commands doesn&#39;t matter, as the Z-Buffer will take care of hiding overlapping objects for us. \nWhen you use transparency however, order most definateley matters! Lets assume you have two objects, a solid and a transparent one. If you draw a solid object first, then a transparent object, you will see the image get blended as expected. But if you draw the transparent object first, then the solid object, the transparent object will draw and blend with the clear color. Then parts of the solid object not overlapping the transparent object will draw. And your scene will look broken. \nThe most common way to handle this is to make two render passes at the scene. First, render only solid objects. Next, enable blending and render only transparent objects. This will fix the problem in 90% of the cases, but sometimes you have overlapping transparent objects!\nThe full fix is to do the two render passes as described above, but also sort the transparent objects so the furthest objects render first. As you will see later, even this isn&#39;t a perfect solution\n"},"Chapter6/blend_practice.html":{"url":"Chapter6/blend_practice.html","title":"Challenge","body":"Blend Practice\nWe&#39;re going to real quick try to render a scene which uses blending.

That&#39;s all there is to transparency.

Alpha values come from textures.\nMess it up!\nWant to see how alpha rendering can go wrong? Change the order up. Render the red sphere first, blue second and green last. Do this without modifying the Z values or color values, just change the order you render them in, to intentionally mess the scene up.\nThe rendered scene will look like this:\n\nIt messes up so bad because we draw the red sphere with nothing in the frame buffer except the clear color, so the red sphere blends on top of the clear color (except a small sliver on it&#39;s bottom that blends with the plane). \nNext we render the blue sphere, again in it&#39;s visible parts we can only blend it with the clear color. You might expect the blue sphere to draw over the red one, but the objects are recorded in the Z buffer as if they where solid. \nThe Z buffer knows no alpha. As far as Z is concerned, the red sphere is closer than the blue sphere, so the fragments of the blue sphere that are behind the red one are simply discarded.\nThe green sphere is only partially visible for the same reason, most of it&#39;s fragments are discarded during the z-test.\n"},"Chapter6/blend_answer.html":{"url":"Chapter6/blend_answer.html","title":"Solution","body":"During the initial setup function\nThis is the code we used to get the demo scene set up\nInitialize\npublic override void Initialize() {\n    base.Initialize();\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0f, 1f, 1f, 0f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, new float[] { .2f, .2f, .2f, 1f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { .8f, .8f, .8f, 1f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f });\n\n    GL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f });\n    GL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 20f);\n\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\n    GL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.AmbientAndDiffuse);\n\n    GL.LightModel(LightModelParameter.LightModelAmbient, new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f });\n}\nRender\npublic override void Render() {\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(new Vector3(0f, 2f, -7f), new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f), new Vector3(0f, 1f, 0f));\n    GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\n    GL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    grid.Render();\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n\n    GL.Color3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(0f, 1f, 3f);\n        Primitives.DrawSphere(3);\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    GL.Color3(0f, 0f, 1f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(1f, 1f, 2f);\n        Primitives.DrawSphere(3);\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n\n    GL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f)\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(0f, 2f, 1f);\n        Primitives.DrawSphere(3);\n    GL.PopMatrix();\n}\nAt this point, your scene should look like this:\n\nNow that the initial scene has been set up, let&#39;s take a look at the code changes we had to make in order to have transperancy work\nInitialize\npublic override void Initialize() {\n    base.Initialize();\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0f, 1f, 1f, 0f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, new float[] { .2f, .2f, .2f, 1f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { .8f, .8f, .8f, 1f });\n    GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f });\n\n    GL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f });\n    GL.Material(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, MaterialParameter.Shininess, 20f);\n\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.ColorMaterial);\n    GL.ColorMaterial(MaterialFace.FrontAndBack, ColorMaterialParameter.AmbientAndDiffuse);\n\n    GL.LightModel(LightModelParameter.LightModelAmbient, new float[] { 0f, 0f, 0f, 1f });\n\n    // NEW\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Blend);\n    GL.BlendFunc(BlendingFactorSrc.SrcAlpha, BlendingFactorDest.OneMinusSrcAlpha);\n}\nRender\npublic override void Render() {\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(new Vector3(0f, 2f, -7f), new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f), new Vector3(0f, 1f, 0f));\n    GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\n    GL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n    grid.Render();\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n\n    GL.Color4(0f, 1f, 0f, 1f);

Nowdays, texture maps are used everywhere in 3D graphics, you&#39;re gonna have a hard time finding a game that doest use textures.\nTexture maps are composed of rectengular arrays of date, each element of these arrays is called a texel. Altough they are rectangular arrays, textures can be mapped to non-rectangular objects. \nIn a picture, each pixel has 4 components (RGBA). Each of these components would be 1 entry in the rectangular texture array. Each component is represented by a value of 0 to 255. So the size of a texture is: width * height * 4 * sizeof(char) Each pixel of that texture is called a texel. \nWhy texel, why not pixel? As we map a texture to a 3D object, and the 3D object to screen, a single pixel in the source texture could occupy multiple pixels on screen (Because of wrapping around a 3D object that could be scaled, rotates, skewed, etc...). Because the mapping is not 1 to 1, the source of the image comes from texel coordinates and the destination on screen is pixel coordinates.\nUsually developers use two-dimensional textures for graphics, however using one dimensional or even 3 dimensional textures is not unheard of. 1D textures have a width. 2D textures have a width and a height (these are the images we are used to as png files). 3D textures have a width, a height and a depth. 3D textures are sometimes called volume textures. We generally only use 1D and 2D textures. 1D is used almost exclusivley for &quot;toon shading&quot;\nWhen you map a texture to a polygon, it will deform with the polygon. In other words, if you rotate the earth, it&#39;s texture will rotate along with the sphere. This applies to all deformations and transformations. \n"},"Chapter7/Enable.html":{"url":"Chapter7/Enable.html","title":"Enable Texturing","body":"Using a texture map\nAs mentioned, textures are images that you apply to polygons. These images are either loaded from a file, or created in code. Once you have a texture in memory, you need to map it to an OpenGL texture object. But before you can do ANY of this, you must first enable texture mapping!\nTo enable / disable texture mapping you will most often use this call:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\nOther acceptable arguments are:\n\nEnableCap.Texture1D\nEnableCap.Texture2D\nEnableCap.Texture3D\nEnableCap.TextureCubeMap\n\nYou must enable the type of texture you want to use. More often than not that is going to be Texture2D. It&#39;s important that you only enable 1 texture type at a time. If you have Texture1D AND Texture2D enabled the render operation might or might not work. It&#39;s undefined. You must disable the old texturing before using the new. For example:\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n// Draw textured objects\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.TextureCubeMap);\n// Draw reflective objects\nGL.Diable(EnableCap.TextureCubeMap);\nThis brings up the next point. When you have texturing enabled, all color info will come from the texture. So, what if you want to draw a textured polygon, but still render an untextured grid? You just disable the texture after you drew the polygon! You could also disable texturing before you draw the grid!\n// Draw the grid unlit and untextured\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\ngrid.Render();\n// Now that the grid is drawn, re-enable lighting and texturing!\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n"},"Chapter7/TextureObj.html":{"url":"Chapter7/TextureObj.html","title":"Texture Objects","body":"Texture Objects\nTexture objects are internal memory to OpenGL that hold texture data and paramaters. Essentially, it&#39;s memory on the GPU. Managing memory on the GPU is dangerous, because of this OpenGL will not give you direct access to it. Instead you cant rack this memory with a unique unsigned integer that acts as a handle. \nThis concept should already be familiar. In our 2D OpenTK Framework, when you loaded a texture it returned an integer. You then used this integer to draw the texture onto screen, and eventually to unload the texture. OpenGL does the same thing.\nThere are two ways to generate new texture handles. You can either request a single one at a time, or if you know how many textures you will need ahead of time you can request them in one big batch.\n// Generate a single texture\nint GL.GenTexture();\n// Generate multiple textures\nvoid GL.GenTextures(int n, out int[] textures);\nGenerating a single texture handle is straight forward. When generating multiple, the function takes as it&#39;s first paramater the number of textures you want. As it&#39;s second paramater it takes an out qualifyed integer array that is large enough to hold all requested handles.\nBefore generating textures, you must enable texturing. This is what we&#39;ve learned so far put to code:\n// Enable Texturing\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n// Generate a texture handle\nint handle = GL.GenTexture();\n// ??? Profit?\nGenerating a texture handle is useless without being able to actually put data in it. We will cover how this works over the next two sections.\n"},"Chapter7/Binding.html":{"url":"Chapter7/Binding.html","title":"Texture Binding","body":"Texture Binding\nIn most API&#39;s that use handles, functions which effect the handle take the handle as their first argument. Take for example how we did our 2D framework:\n// This is NOT OpenGL, it&#39;s from the 2D framewrok\n\n// First we intialize the texture manager\nTextureManager.Instance.Initialize(Window);\n\n// Next we generate a texture handle\nint texBird = TextureManager.Instance.LoadTexture(&quot;Assets/Bird.png&quot;);\n\n// Finally we draw the texture by passing the handle\n// as the first paramater to the draw function\nTextureManager.Instance.Draw(texBird, new Point(0, 0));\nOpenGL does not work like this.\nBinding\nOpenGL has the concept of a &quot;currently bound texture&quot;. When you plan to use a texture for anything (rendering usually), you bind it to the OpenGL context (with the GL.BindTexture function). After a texture is bound, all subsequent operations that use textures will use the currently bound texture.\nThis is what the function call for binding a texture looks like:\nGL.BindTexture(TextureTarget proxy, int texId);\nTo bind no texture, set the second argument (texId) to 0. By default, no texture is bound. What is the first argument? That TextureTarget enumeration.... It&#39;s a list of texture types that can be bound. We only care about the following entries:\n\nTextureTarget.Texture1D\nTextureTarget.Texture2D\nTextureTarget.Texture3D\nTextureTarget.TextureCubeMap\n\nThere are a lot of other options, but seeing how those are the four texture types we can actually create, they are the only ones we care about.\nWhat happens if you enable Texture2D, then try to bind a Texture1D object? Nothing. No errors, nothing. But also, nothing will be drawn. More often that not you will be using Texture2D for this argument. If you are not getting anything rendering on screen, make sure you have the right texture unit enabled.\nA bound texture will remain bound until it is either unbound, or deleted. It&#39;s GOOD PRACTICE to unbind your texture (by binding 0), after you are done drawing with it.\nHere is what we&#39;ve learned so far:\n// Enable Texturing\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n// Generate a texture handle\nint handle = GL.GenTexture();\n// Bind the handle we generated as the active texture object\nGL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, handle);\n// ???\nNow that we have generated a texture, and told OpenGL that we want to make changes to it by binding the texture handle, it&#39;s time to actually fill the texture with some data. We will discuss how to do this in the next section.\n"},"Chapter7/SpecTex.html":{"url":"Chapter7/SpecTex.html","title":"Specifying Textures","body":"Specifying Textures\nNow that a texture object has been created on the GPU and it&#39;s associated handle has been bound as the active texture, it&#39;s time to actually fill that texture object with data.\nIt&#39;s important to make the distinction between GPU memory and CPU memory. You have control of CPU memory, but not GPU memory. Rendering is done mostly using GPU memory. Therefore, to render a texture, you must upload it to GPU memory.\nThe process of getting a texture into GPU memory is fairly straight forward. \n\nFirst, you must have the texture object you want to fill with data bound. \nRead the texture data into CPU memory.\nUpload to the GPU with GL.TexImage2D\nAt this point, you can manually delete CPU memory\nOr let the garbage collector do it, depends on how you loaded the texture\n\n\n\nThe GL.TexImage2D function is fairly straight forward, but it does have a lot of arguments\nGL.TexImage2D(TextureTarget target, int level, PixelInternalFormat internalFormat, int width, int height, int border, PixelFormat sourceFormat, PixelType sourceType, IntPtr data)\nLet&#39;s break each argument down\n\nTextureTarget target\nWhich texture are we loading data into? Texture1D, Texture2D, etc..\nMost often (99% of the time) this will be TextureTarget.Texture2D\n\n\nint level\nSpecifies how many levels of detail the image has. \nLevel 0 is the base, each additional level is a new mip-map\nWe will cover mip-maps later. For now, keep this at 0\n\n\nPixelInternalFormat internalFormat\nSpecifies what the image is formatted for, Color, Light, etc..\n99% of the time you will use: PixelInternalFormat.Rgba\nThe other two that we use are:\nPixelInternalFormat.Rgb\nPixelInternalFormat.Alpha\n\n\nThere are other options, but they are not useful for games. \n\n\nint width\nSpecifies the width of the texture being loaded\nRemember, you should be using a power of 2!\n\n\nint height\nSpecifies the height of the texture being loaded\nRemember, you should be using a power of 2!\n\n\nint border\nSpecifies a memory border, NOT a pixel border\nWhen written to OpenGL throws an error \nTHIS MUST BE 0 (I don&#39;t know why they included this paramater)\n\n\nPixelFormat sourceFormat\nSpefifies how the source data is laid out \nValues are Argb, Bgra, Rgb, Alpha, etc... \n\n\nPixelType sourceType\nSpecifies what data type we are storing the source as\nMost often this will be an unsigned byte, values are:\nPixelType.UnsignedByte\nPixelType.Short\nPixelType.Int\n\n\nThere are more types, but those are the 3 you will most often use \n\n\nIntPtr data\nAn IntPtr is an unsafe data type\nIt can point to any array of numeric data (int[], byte[], etc...)\nThis is a long, single dimensional array containing the pixels to upload to the GPU\n\n\n\nThe function looks complicated, but you only have to really write it once in a friendly wrapper. After calling this function, you can discard the pixel data you are holding onto on the CPU, as the function will have uploaded it to the GPU\nDecoder\nSo, how do we get that array of bytes that represents the texture? We have to decode a texture from it&#39;s source format (png, jpg, tga, etc...) into an array of bytes. We&#39;re going to use built-in windows functions to do this.\nIn order to use windows to decode, you must include a reference to System.Drawing, as it contains the Bitmap class that we will use to decode the texture. The following block of code is commented to explain what is involved in devoding a texture. \nprivate int LoadGLTexture(string filename, out int width, out int height) {\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(filename)) {\n        Error(&quot;Load texture file path was null&quot;);\n        throw new ArgumentException(filename);\n    }\n\n    // Generate a handle on the GPU\n    int id = GL.GenTexture();\n\n    // Bind the handle to the be the active texture.\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, id);\n\n    /* TODO: \n     *    Set appropriate min and mag filters\n     *    we will talk about these in the next section\n    */\n\n    // Allocate CPU system memory for the image\n    // This will load the encoded texture into CPU memory\n    Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(filename);\n\n    // Decode the image data and store the byte array into CPU memory\n    BitmapData bmp_data = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);\n\n    /* TODO: \n     *    Check bmp.Width and bmp.Height, if they are not a power\n     *    of two, throw an error\n    */\n\n    // Upload the image data to the GPU\n    GL.TexImage2D(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0, PixelInternalFormat.Rgba, bmp_data.Width, bmp_data.Height, 0, OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.PixelFormat.Bgra, PixelType.UnsignedByte, bmp_data.Scan0);\n\n    // Mark CPU memory eligable for GC, disposing it\n    bmp.UnlockBits(bmp_data);\n    bmp.Dispose();\n\n    // Return the textures width, height and GPU ID\n    width = bmp.Width;\n    height = bmp.Height;\n    return id;\n}\nUsing this function is pretty easy. It returns the texture handle and gives you the width &amp; height of the loaded texture as out paramaters:\nint texWidth = -1;\nint texHeight = -1;\nint texHandle = LoadGLTexture(&quot;File.png&quot;, out texWidth, out texHeight);\nSo far\nReading the above code, you will notice that we&#39;ve wrapped not only GL.TexImage2D, but also GL.GenTexture and GL.BindTexture into the LoadGLTexture helper function. So, our code to load (and eventually display) a texture becomes:\n// Enable Texturing\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n// Generate a texture handle, bind it and load it with data\nint width = -1;\nint height = -1;\nint handle = LoadGLTexture(file.png, out width, out height);\nWidth &amp; Height\nBy far the easyest way to obtain the width and height of a texture is to store it at the time of loading that texture. However, you don&#39;t HAVE to do it this way. You can get the width or height of a texture anytime with the   function.\nint GetWidth(int textureId) {\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, textureId);\n    int result = 0;\n    GL.GetTexLevelParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0, GetTextureParameter.TextureWidth, out result);\n    return result;\n}\nBut just storing the width / height at load time is much easyer and much more performant!\nOther loading methods\nThe method we used to load textures here is by far the simplest. It relies on Windows to decode texture files for us. Sometimes, this isn&#39;t an option tough. For example, on an iPhone. So, how can we decode textures on non-windows platforms?\nA common method is to use stb_image or LodePng. Both are C libraries that you have to compile into a .dll file and link against. Once compiled, you can use C#&#39;s interop features to access the C functions.\nIf that sounds like a lot of work just to load a texture, well that&#39;s because it is! Another way to get texture loading to work is to browse NuGet for a png or jpg decoder package. NuGet is the Visual Studio package manager we used to link against OpenGL (In the form of OpenTK) and NAudio. \nWe actually use NAudio that we got trough NuGet to decode mp3 files in the OpenTK framework. You can find LodePNG on NuGet if you want to play around with a third party decoder. LodePNG is actually faster than the built in Windows decoder.\n"},"Chapter7/MinMag.html":{"url":"Chapter7/MinMag.html","title":"Min & Mag Filters","body":"Min and Mag Filters\nWe&#39;re almost done! We&#39;ve managed to load some memory onto the GPU at this point, but if we tried to render that memory as a texutre, nothing would show up. This is because our texture loading code neglected to specify min and mag filters. There is a TODO comment section in the function.\nMin and mag filters describe to OpenGL what to do when we are trying to render a 256x256 texture on a 512x512 surface, or even a 128x128 surface! There is no clear way to map the pixels of a smaller image to a larger surface or a larger image to a smaller surface. Each approach in handling the problem has it&#39;s own ups and downs, so OpenGL lets you pick what to do.\nWhat is a Min filter\nMin filter is the minification filter. It is applied when an image is zoomed out so far that multiple pixels (texels) on the source image make up a single pixel (fragment) on the display screen. There are two common settings\n\nNearest\nNearest neigbor filtering, does not attempt to scale the image\nResult is sharp / pixelated\n\n\nBilinear\nBilinear filtering, attempts to resize the image\nResult is soft / blurred\n\n\n\nEither way you set the min filter, the resulting image will be less than ideal because certain pixels have to be skipped. Usually, min filtering only needs to effect far away objects, so this isn&#39;t too big of an issue.\n\nWhat is a Mag filter\nMag filter is the magnification filter. It is applied when an image is zoomed in so close that one pixel (texel) on the source image takes up multiple pixels (fragments) on the display screen. There are two common settings for mag filtering:\n\nNearest \nNearest neightbor filtering means no scale is applied to the texture\nThe resulting image will be sharp, but very pixelated\n\n\nBilinear\nUse bilinear filtering to resize (enlarge) the source image\nThe result will be blured, but the image will look smooth\n\n\n\n\nTogether now\n99% of the time you will set these properties to be the same. That is you will have a nearest min and mag, or a bilinear min and mag. It&#39;s RARE (I have never done this) to need a nearest mag and a bilinear min.\n2D games (Like our OpenTK framework) tend to use nearest neighbor filtering. This helps keep pixels looking sharp and crisp! It&#39;s an art style, after all you don&#39;t want mario to have blurry edges.\nIn contrast 3D games tend to use bilinear filtering. Because the world is smooth and continous, you really want to maintain that illusion, even if it means blurring your image a little.\nThere are of course exceptions. Minecraft for instance uses nearest neighbor filtering despite being a 3D game. And most Klei games use bilinear filtering, even tough they are 2D games.\nCode\nSetting the min and mag filters in code is pretty straight forward. You call the GL.TexParameter function two times, once for the min and once for the mag filters.\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget target, TextureParameterName param, int value)\nThe first argument, target is of course which texture this command targets. More often than not the value of this is going to be Texture2D. The second paramater, param is the important one, it tells OpenGL what texture paramater you are setting. We want to set TextureMagFilter or TextureMinFilter. The last paramater is an integer, this is a bit of a magic number. There is an enumeration TextureMagFilter, you can cast the values of this enum into an int for the last paramater\nKnowing what the function looks like, this is how you would go about setting a linear filter\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, (int)TextureMinFilter.Linear);\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMagFilter, (int)TextureMagFilter.Linear);\nAnd this is how you would set a nearest filter\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, (int)TextureMinFilter.Nearest);\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMagFilter, (int)TextureMagFilter.Nearest);\nLoad Texture\nLet&#39;s retrofit setting the min and mag filters into the LoadGLTexture function we wrote in the last section. We&#39;re going to take advantage of the fact that both min and mag filters tend to be set to the same value by simply adding one new argument to the function.\nThis new argument, bool nearest if true will make the function use nearest filtering. If false, it will use bilinear.\nprivate int LoadGLTexture(string filename, out int width, out int height, bool nearest) {\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(filename)) {\n        Error(&quot;Load texture file path was null&quot;);\n        throw new ArgumentException(filename);\n    }\n\n    // Generate a handle on the GPU\n    int id = GL.GenTexture();\n\n    // Bind the handle to the be the active texture.\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, id);\n\n    ///////////////////////////////////////////////\n    // THIS IS NEW\n    Set appropriate filters\n    if (nearest) {\n        GL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, (int)TextureMinFilter.Nearest);\n        GL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMagFilter, (int)TextureMagFilter.Nearest);\n    }\n    else {\n        GL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, (int)TextureMinFilter.Linear);\n        GL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMagFilter, (int)TextureMagFilter.Linear);\n    }\n    ///////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n    // Allocate CPU system memory for the image\n    // This will load the encoded texture into CPU memory\n    Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(filename);\n\n    // Decode the image data and store the byte array into CPU memory\n    BitmapData bmp_data = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);\n\n    /* TODO: \n     *    Check bmp.Width and bmp.Height, if they are not a power\n     *    of two, throw an error\n    */\n\n    // Upload the image data to the GPU\n    GL.TexImage2D(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0, PixelInternalFormat.Rgba, bmp_data.Width, bmp_data.Height, 0, OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.PixelFormat.Bgra, PixelType.UnsignedByte, bmp_data.Scan0);\n\n    // Mark CPU memory eligable for GC, disposing it\n    bmp.UnlockBits(bmp_data);\n\n    // Return the textures width, height and GPU ID\n    width = bmp.Width;\n    height = bmp.Height;\n    return id;\n}\nIn this example we set the texture filter after the texture was bound, but before it is filled with data. So long as the texture is bound, we can set its filtering mode any time, you don&#39;t HAVE to set it before it is filled with data. As a matter of fact, you can change this during runtime!\nHowever it&#39;s considered best practice to set the filtering before filling a texture with data, and changing the filtering at runtime has a MUCH higher performance penalty than just having a second, duplicate texture with different filtering. So, follow the above convention.\nDone loading\nWow, that&#39;s it. This image is now ready to be displayed! In general you will want to load all your images in an initialize function, delete them all in a shutdown function and draw them all in a render function.\nWe&#39;ve finally gone trough all the code required in the inialize section of your application. Let&#39;s take a look at what is involved in deleting texutres on shutdown before we actually render anything!\n"},"Chapter7/DelTex.html":{"url":"Chapter7/DelTex.html","title":"Deleting Textures","body":"Deleting textures\nNow that we know exactly what we have to do in the initialize function of a textured application, let&#39;s take a quick look at how to clean up a texture handle. This could not be any easyer.\nFirst, make sure the texture you are deleting isn&#39;t bound! Remember, you can always bind 0 as the active texture (effectivley binding null). Next, you need to pass the textures handle to the   function. This function has two variations:\nvoid GL.DeleteTexture(int texture);\nvoid GL.DeleteTextures(int n, int[] textures);\n// The first argument of the second function (n) is\n// the length of the textures array.\nOne of them takes a single handle and deletes it, the other takes an array of handles and deletes them all. It should be common sense, but once a texture is deleted you should not use it. If you do, no error will be thrown, but undefined behaviour will happen!\nSo Far\nWe&#39;re almost ready to draw some textured stuff! Let&#39;s recap the texturing process so far:\nint texture1 = -1;\nint texture2 = -1;\n\nvoid Initialize() {\n    // Enable Texturing\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n\n    int width = -1;\n    int height = -1;\n\n    // Load in textures, we don&#39;t even care \n    // about the width / height right now\n    // Be sure to use the version of this \n    // function that specifies a min &amp; mag filter!\n    texture1 = LoadGLTexture(&quot;file.png&quot;, out width, out height, true);\n    texture2 = LoadGLTexture(&quot;file2.png&quot;, out width, out height, false);\n}\n\nvoid Render() {\n    // TODO: Render textures!\n}\n\nvoid Shutdown() {\n    // Now that we are done, delete the texture handles!\n    GL.DeleteTexture(texture1);\n    GL.DeleteTexture(texture2);\n\n    // And i like to set any int references to invalid values\n    // just so i know that these are no longer usable\n    texture1 = texture2 = -1;\n}\n"},"Chapter7/TexCoords.html":{"url":"Chapter7/TexCoords.html","title":"Texture Coordinates","body":"Texture Coordinates\nNow that we can load and unload textures it&#39;s finally time to texture something! In order to apply a texture to a 3D model, you must first specify some texture coordinates for each vertex of that model. So far we&#39;ve given a vertex a position, a color, a normal; now we add texture coordinates to the list of attributes a vertex can have.\nTexture coordinates have some special vocabulary. We call the texture coordinates UV coordinates. This is because a texture is not read on an X-Y axis like you might expect, rather a texture is read using a U-V axis. The U axis is horizontal, the V axis is vertical. 0, 0 is in the bottom left. When we use subscript notation, U comes first: (U, V)\nThe other thing to know about U-V space is that it is normalized. It doesn&#39;t matter if a texture is 124x124, 256x256, 512x1024 or whatever. The U-V coordinate space always extends from 0 to 1. The center pixel of an image is always at point (0.5f, 0.5f).\nIn this image, the left side shows a png picture, the right side shows the picture being applyed onto a triangle. The triangle is also outlined on top of the image. The UV coordinates of this triangles vertices are (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0). \n\nWhat happens when your texture isn&#39;t a square? Let&#39;s say you have 512x1024. Then the UV coordinate (0.5f, 0.5f) maps to the pixel at  256x512. I can&#39;t stress this enough, images should always be square and a power of two. This will help keep coordinates simple, and will run faster on your graphics card.\nWhile we&#39;re talking about textures, let&#39;s review why a power of two textue is faster on a graphics card. A U-V coordinate doesn&#39;t map to a pixel, it maps to a texel. As such, each pixel on an image might take up one or more pixels on the actual render target, or no pixels at all. In order to convert texels to pixels, a graphics card must divide by 2.\nIf you remember WAY back to when we started programming, we briefley talked about bitshifting. Let&#39;s take the binary number for 4 for example: 0000 0100. If we right shift this by 1 &gt;&gt; 1 the result is two: 000 0010. We just achived the same thing as a division by two, except this is about 500 times less expensive than division! This trick only works with powers of two.\nTex Coords\nAlright, enough theory. You can specify texture coordinates for vertices using the GL.TexCoord2 function. This function has the following signature:\nGL.TexCoord2(float s, float t);\nWhere S is the U axis and T is the V axis. So, if we wanted for example to draw a textured quad on screen, we would specify UV coordinates for each vertex, like so:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 1);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(left, bottom, 0.0f); // Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 1);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(right, bottom, 0.0f);// Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 0);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(right, top, 0.0f);   // Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 0);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(left, top, 0.0f);    // Where on screen to draw it\nGL.End();\nNotice how i define the UV coordinate before the vertex. You specify whatever attributes a vertex needs, you could even specify all the attributes we&#39;ve used until now for a single vertex!\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n    GL.TexCoord2(1f, 1f);\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Color3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1f, 0f);\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Color3(1f, 0f, 0f);\n    GL.Vertex3(1f, 0f, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(0f, 0f);\n    GL.Normal3(0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Color3(0f, 0f, 1f)\n    GL.Vertex3(-1f, 0f, 0f);\nGL.End();\nThe order in which you define the vertex attributes does not matter so long as A) you are consistent within the Begin / End calls and B) the GL.Vertex3 call specifying position comes last. \nMost of the time when you specify a texture you will not specify a color. But position and normal will usually be specified for all 3D models. UI and 2D games tend to only use UV-Coords and position.\nSo far\nIt&#39;s not enough to just specify texture coordinates. Texturing must be enabled, and a valid texture must be bound. Let&#39;s see some code as to what it takes to draw a textured quad:\nint textureHandle = -1;\nint textureWidth = -1;\nint textureHeight = -1;\n\nvoid Initialize() {\n    // Enable Texturing\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n\n    // Take note, we store the width and height!\n    textureHandle = LoadGLTexture(&quot;file.png&quot;, out textureWidth, out textureHeight, true);\n}\n\nvoid Render() {\n    // World coordinates of the quad we are drawing\n    float left = 0f;\n    float right = 20f;\n    float top = 0f;\n    float bottom = 10f;\n\n    // We have to bind a valid texture to draw\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, textureHandle);\n\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n        GL.TexCoord2(0, 1);\n        GL.Vertex3(left, bottom, 0.0f);\n\n        GL.TexCoord2(1, 1); \n        GL.Vertex3(right, bottom, 0.0f);\n\n        GL.TexCoord2(1, 0); \n        GL.Vertex3(right, top, 0.0f); \n\n        GL.TexCoord2(0, 0); \n        GL.Vertex3(left, top, 0.0f);\n    GL.End();\n\n    // You don&#39;t have to do this, but i don&#39;t like leaving bound textures\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0);\n}\n\nvoid Shutdown() {\n    // Now that we are done, delete the texture handles!\n    GL.DeleteTexture(textureHandle);\n\n    // Invalidate references\n    textureHandle = -1;\n}\nThat&#39;s a lot of code, and it&#39;s even more when you consider that all our texture loading code is nicley wrapped up in the LoadGLTexture function, not shown here. But that&#39;s what it takes to draw a textured primitive.\nSo, let&#39;s pretend that the quad we drew is a health bar. And the health bar is on an atlas. Our artist tells us that the UV-Coordinates for this health bar are at top-left:125x34, bottom-right(150, 50). How do we take those pixel coordinates and convert them into UV-coords? \nBy normalizing them. That is, divide the X pixel by the width or the imge, and the Y pixel by the height of the image. This will put the pixel coordinates into a normal space. Let&#39;s take a look at how we might change the render function to do this:\nvoid Render() {\n    // Normalized uv coordinates, remember we kept a reference\n    // to the width and height of the image, returned \n    // from the LoadGLTexture function.\n    float uv_left = 125f / textureWidth;\n    float uv_right = 150f / textureWidth;\n    float uv_top = 34f / textureHeight;\n    float uv_bottom = 50f / textureHeight;\n\n    // World coordinates of the quad we are drawing\n    float left = 0f;\n    float right = 20f;\n    float top = 0f;\n    float bottom = 10f;\n\n    // We have to bind a valid texture to draw\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, textureHandle);\n\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n        GL.TexCoord2(uv_left, uv_bottom);\n        GL.Vertex3(left, bottom, 0f);\n\n        GL.TexCoord2(uv_right, uv_bottom); \n        GL.Vertex3(right, bottom, 0f);\n\n        GL.TexCoord2(uv_right, uv_top); \n        GL.Vertex3(right, top, 0f); \n\n        GL.TexCoord2(uv_left, uv_top); \n        GL.Vertex3(left, top, 0f);\n    GL.End();\n\n    // You don&#39;t have to do this, but i don&#39;t like leaving bound textures\n    GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0);\n}\nYou will notice in my code that i map the Y axis of my UV-Coordinates in reverse. This is because having (0, 0) on the bottom left makes no sense to me. So i map the UV&#39;s in reverse, effectivley putting (0, 0) at the top left of uv-space.\nOne trick i like to use to avoid dividing twice is reciprical multiplication. This code:\nfloat uv_top = 34f / textureHeight;\nfloat uv_bottom = 50f / textureHeight;\ncan be written as\nfloat inverseHeight = 1f / textureHeight;\nfloat uv_top = 34f * inverseHeight;\nfloat uv_bottom = 50f * inverseHeight;\nThe final values of uv_top and uv_bottom will be the same, but instead of doing two divisions we now do 1 division and two multiplications. Which is actually faster. Not by a lot, but still faster.\nWhat&#39;s next\nBefore we move on to the &quot;putting it all together&quot; section where we actually write code i want you to take a peek into the 2DOpenTKFramework we&#39;ve been using to make 2D games. Specifically, i want you to check out the TextureManager.cs file, it&#39;s the one with all the texture goodies. \nThere is a specific function in there, it takes a texture-id and a screen rectangle. It draws the texture in it&#39;s entirety to the screen. The signature of this function is:\npublic void Draw(int textureId, Point screenPosition)\nIt&#39;s heavily commented, it should be easy to see how it works. If you have a pretty good grasp on how that function works, and feel up to a challenge, take a look at it&#39;s cousin with the overrides:\npublic void Draw(int textureId, Point screenPosition, PointF scale, Rectangle sourceSection)\nThis function does a bunch of math (mostly multiplication) to convert pixel coordinates on the source texture into normalized texture coordinates.\n"},"Chapter7/Ex1.html":{"url":"Chapter7/Ex1.html","title":"Putting it all together","body":"Putting it all together\nNow we know everything we need to know to make a simple textured scene! Nothing left to do except actually make something textured! In this section i&#39;m going to walk you trough setting up a simple textured scene, but the actual texturing work will be up to you.\nPutting together the test scene\nThe name of this new test scene will be TexturedPlanes, so create it in a file called TexturedPlanes.cs. For the last few examples, they have all extended a sample scene, not the empty game scene. I want to make sure we start from scratch here, notice that the TexturedPlanes class extends the Game scene, not the LightingExample class like the lighting examples before this.\nSo, we&#39;re going to need to make a member grid, inside the intialize function we will make a new grid. Also inside of initialize we need to enable depth testing for a proper depth buffer, as well as face culling. The shutdown function is going to stay empty for now.\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Drawing.Imaging;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\nusing Math_Implementation;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class TexturedPlanes : Game {\n        protected Grid grid = null;\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            base.Initialize();\n            grid = new Grid(true);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\n        }\n\n        public override void Shutdown() {\n            base.Shutdown();\n        }\n\nThe render function is going to set the camera at position (-7, 5, -7), looking at point (0, 0, 0). So we are going to load the appropriate view matrix. \nThen we&#39;re going to render our standard grid background. Take note, when we draw the grid we disable texturing, then re-enable texturing. This is because the grid color should come from GL.Color3, not the active texture.\n        public override void Render() {\n            Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(new Vector3(-7.0f, 5.0f, -7.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));\n            GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\n            GL.Disable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n            GL.Disable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            grid.Render();\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n        }\n\nFinally the resize function is going to set the viewport and load an updated projection matrix, then set the active matrix back to the modelview matrix.\n        public override void Resize(int width, int height) {\n            GL.Viewport(0, 0, width, height);\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n            float aspect = (float)width / (float)height;\n            Matrix4 perspective = Matrix4.Perspective(60.0f, aspect, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\n            GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(perspective).Matrix);\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAt this point, the test scene should look like this:\n\nNow, let&#39;s add a quad to the scene that is to be rendered. We are going to draw this quad using two triangles. I&#39;ll make sure to comment the code to specify which vertex is which corner of the quad. Because we use two triangles, two of the corners will be defined twice. \nModify the Render function, by adding this code at it&#39;s end:\nGL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n\nGL.Vertex3(1, 4,  2); // Top Right\nGL.Vertex3(1, 4, -2); // Top Let\nGL.Vertex3(1, 0, -2); // Bottom Left\n\nGL.Vertex3(1, 4,  2); // Top Right\nGL.Vertex3(1, 0, -2); // Bottom Left\nGL.Vertex3(1, 0,  2); // Bottom Right\n\nGL.End();\n\nYour scene should now look like this:\n\nOn your Own\nFirst, make an assets directory and save this image into it:\n\nRemember, you have to set visual studio&#39;s working directory to one above the asset directory for loading resources! Just like with the 2D games.\nWe are going to do everything inline for now, so no LoadTexture helper function. Back to our code, do the following:\n\nMake a new integer member variable\nThis is going to be a texture handle\n\n\nIn initialize, enable texturing\nIn initialize, generate a texture handle\nAssign the result to the member variable you created earlyer \n\n\nIn initialize, bind the new texture handle \nIn initialize, set the min and mag filters to linear\nIn initialize, load the texture data into the handle\nThis can be done in 5 lines of code, again no helper function\nIf you get stuck, look at the &quot;Loading Help&quot; sub page\n\n\nIn shutdown, delete the texture handle\nRemember to unbind it first! \n\n\nIn render, bind the texture handle before drawing the quad\nYou MUST do this before GL.Begin\n\n\nIn Render, add UV coordinates to each vertex \n\nRunning your game should show the textured quad. It should look like this:\n\nBefore we render the quad we set the color to white with this code: GL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);. Try setting that to blue to see how vertex colors affect textures. \nAdding some detail\nRendering a textured quad is interesting, but we can make this a bit better. Let&#39;s add two more quads and explore how to render images with some alpha in them! Just like above, i&#39;m going to walk you trough adding the geometry for these images to the scene, but then it&#39;s going to be all you when it comes to actually texturing them.\nFirst things first tough, save the following image to your Assets directory. I call my version of it houses.png\n\nLet&#39;s modify the render function. After the crazy taxy texture is rendered, add the following code:\n// TODO: When you do texturing, remove the Disable call\nGL.Disable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n\n// House 1\nGL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);\n    GL.PushMatrix();\n        GL.Translate(-1f, 0.5f, -1f);\n        GL.Rotate(-130f, 0f, 1f, 0f);\n        GL.Scale(0.57f, 1f, 1f);\n        GL.Scale(3f, 3f, 3f);\n        GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n        GL.Vertex3(0.5, 0.5, 0);//top right\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.5, 0.5, 0);//top left\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.5, -0.5, 0);//bottom left\n\n        GL.Vertex3(0.5, 0.5, 0);//top right\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.5, -0.5, 0);//bottom left\n        GL.Vertex3(0.5, -0.5, 0);//bottom Right\n    GL.End();\nGL.PopMatrix();\n\n// House 2\nGL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);\nGL.PushMatrix();\n    GL.Translate(-2f, 0.5f, -3f);\n    GL.Rotate(-130f, 0f, 1f, 0f);\n    GL.Scale(0.53f, 1f, 1f);\n    GL.Scale(3f, 3f, 3f);\n    GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n        GL.Vertex3(0.5, 0.5, 0);//top right\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.5, 0.5, 0);//top left\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.5, -0.5, 0);//bottom left\n\n        GL.Vertex3(0.5, 0.5, 0);//top right\n        GL.Vertex3(-0.5, -0.5, 0);//bottom left\n        GL.Vertex3(0.5, -0.5, 0);//bottom Right\n    GL.End();\nGL.PopMatrix();\n\n// TODO: When you do texturing, remove the Enable call\nGL.Enable(EnableCap.Texture2D);\n\nFor now we disable texturing before drawing the quads, then enable it after were done. We do this so we can confirm that the white boxes are rendered correctly. If we didn&#39;t do this, the color of those boxes would be undefined, as OpenGL would try to read the color from the texture, for a model with no UV coordinates.\nWhat this does is simple. We render a plane with a width of 1 and a height of 1 (a depth of 0). Then we use matrix transformations to move the plane into position in the world, rotate it towards the camera, adjust it&#39;s aspect ratio and scale it up. The following lines adjust the aspect ratio:\n...\n    GL.Scale(0.57f, 1f, 1f);\n...\n    GL.Scale(0.53f, 1f, 1f);\n...\nWhere do 0.57 and 0.53 come from? Just like with the screen aspect ratio, any aspect is width divided by height. The first building is 186/326 which equals 0.57. The second building is 180/336 which equals 0.53. Of course i&#39;m rounding the number a bit ;). \nThe size and location of the texture bits is on the actual texture sheet. The aspect ratio of an image is the scale of it&#39;s width compared to its height. So at a scale of 1, the width of an image is it&#39;s aspect.\nRunning the game, your scene should look like this:\n\nOn Your Own\nNow that we have some sample planes rendering, let&#39;s actually texture them. You are going to have to do this bit on your own. Just like above, don&#39;t make a helper function, write out all the code.\n\nFirst, create another class scope texture handle\nEven tough we&#39;re texturing 2 objects, they are in an atlas \n\n\nIn initialize, generate a new handle for this texture\nIn initialize, bind the newly created handle\nIn initialize, set min and mag filters\nIn initialize, load the png file into this new texture handle\nIn shutdown, delete the actual texture handle\nSet the member variable to -1, to signify that it&#39;s invalid\n\n\nIn Render, remove the enable and disable texturing around the two new quads\nBefore rendering the quads, bind the houses texture\nIt&#39;s a good idea to bind 0 at the end of the render loop\n\n\nIn render, add UV coordinates for each square\nTo display each house you will need to know where it&#39;s\nrectangle is and bring it into (normalized) uv space.\n\n\n\nOnce you havedone all of that, running the game should look like this:\n\nWell, that&#39;s cool. But it&#39;s not. Why is the alpha section of the image black? It has alpha pixels! Shouldn&#39;t it be transparent?!?!?\nYes and no. The fact is, those are transparent pixels. But if you remember, transparency is not magic. It&#39;s not free. And it&#39;s not on by default. Let&#39;s fix this. Do the following\n\nIn initialize enable blending\nIn initialize set the blend function\n\nOnce you have done that, your scene will look like this:\n\nOne more thing you can try. To see how the order of the sprites effects transparency, try moving the code that renders house 2 above the code that renders house 1. Just to see the artifacts it causes. You need to know what it looks like when you have wrong z-order for alpha blending, and this is the perfect example to check out. \nHere is what that would look like, but try it anyway:\n\nThis happens because the rendering goes like this now:\n\nFirst the grid renders\nThen crazy taxy renders\nThen the closest (green) building renders.\nIt&#39;s alpha pixes blend with whats on screen (grid &amp; taxi)\n\n\nFinally the further (brown) building renders\nIt blends with whats on screen (grid, taxi, green building)\nThe green building is still rendered on a QUAD geometry\nSo a quad is written to the Z-Buffer\nThis quad has a closer Z than the new geometry, \nNew geometry which fails z-test and does not render in area\n\n\n\nAnd this is why order matters when you are rendering alpha blended objects. You ALWAYS should be rendering the objects furthest away first, and then the closer objects.\n"},"Chapter7/help.html":{"url":"Chapter7/help.html","title":"Loading Help","body":"Loading an OpenGL image\nLoading an OpenGL image can be done in 5 lines of code. \nBitmap bmp = new Bitmap(&quot;SomeImageFile.png&quot;);\nBitmapData bmp_data = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);\nGL.TexImage2D(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0, PixelInternalFormat.Rgba, bmp_data.Width, bmp_data.Height, 0, OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.PixelFormat.Bgra, PixelType.UnsignedByte, bmp_data.Scan0);\nbmp.UnlockBits(bmp_data);\nbmp.Dispose();\n\nThree of these 5 lines are just fillers.

Before we can talk about how mip mapping works, we need to discuss what texel swimming is, and why it&#39;s a problem. consider the following image:\n\nThe left side shows a scene without mip mapping, the right side shows the same scene with linear mip mapping. Notice how even tough the image is a straight grid, off in the distance a wavy distortion startes to happen. This phenomenon is called texel swimming. \nTexel happens because the further away a textured pixel is, the more super sampled it becomes. That is, the span of 3 pixels on the source image are compressed into perhaps a single pixel on screen. When applying a perspective distortion to an image, the swimming artifacts appear.\nHow does mip mapping solve this? By using several resolutions of an image in memory, and sampling the correct one depending on how far away screen pixel is. This way you are more likeley to get a 1 to 1 texture mapping from source to screen and less likeley to see texel swimming. Consider the following image:\n\nThe further away you view the wall segment, the smaller the version of the image you need to sample. That is, the closer a wall the more detail it needs (sample a 256x256 version of the wall texture) but the further away the wall is, the less textures it is on screen. That means when the wall is far away a 32 x 32 version of the wall texture has enough detail.\nOf course because you are sampling an image at different resolutions the resulting image will look blurred based on what resolution the specific image is sampled at. Take a look:\n\nThis may seem unreasonable, i mean doesn&#39;t blurring the image make the world look worse? In simple cases yes. But look at this example scene, it&#39;s not a complex scene, but adding mip-mapping makes a LOT of difference in the overall quality:\n\nTexture piramid\nLike i said mip mapping is based on the pixel being rendered&#39;s distance to the camera. This image demonstrated the different mip levels being used\n\nThe way to visualize what pixel uses what mip is by thinking of the pixel as a texture pyramid:\n\nThe closer a pixel is to the camera, the closer it is the mip level 0. The further it is from the camera, the closer it is to a deeper mip level (like 2). So what does a mip mapped image look like in memory? Like this:\n\nIt&#39;s still a single texture, but that single texture is now larger, and holds multiple copies of the image at different scales. For example, if a base texture is 1024x1024, the mipmapped version of that texture will have a resolution of 1536x1024 and will contain resized versions of the image. (1536 = 1024 + 512)\nWhen a mip map texture is generated, the image keeps being halved until it is only a single pixel. Each time the image is halved it&#39;s called a new mip level. The base image is level 0, the last level could be anything depending on the size of the original image.\nWhere do mip maps come from?\nA natural next question to ask is where do mip maps come from? There are two possible sources for mip maps. Most of the time you will have OpenGL generate mip maps for you. But it&#39;s also possible to upload a texture that is pre-mipmapped. \nSome graphics cards don&#39;t support uploading pre-mipmapped images as they store the mip format in a proprietary way. Because of this, to reach as many devices as possible, we tend to let OpenGL generate mipmaps for as as the default.\nThe best argument for uploading pre-mipmapped images comes from this OpenTK article. They use a different colored image for each mip-level to debug the application and make it look better. Their multi-image mip looks like this when rendered:\n\nLets see some code!\nYou don&#39;t have to follow along with this code, BUT when you do make a 3D world you will need it. As such, while you don&#39;t HAVE to follow along, you most certainly CAN. You can mip-map any scene that uses textures. The best place to start would be to add mip-maps to the scene from the Putting it all together section.\nMip mapping happens when a texture is being put trough the min and mag filters. As such, the first step is to modify the min filter. Instead of using TextureMinFilter.Linear as the argument use  TextureMinFilter.LinearMipmapLinear. \nTake note, mip mapping is for min filters only, as such the TextureMinFilter enum contains this option, but the TextureMagFilter enum does not.\nWith all that being said, keep the mag filter on linear and configure the min filter  like so:\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, (int)TextureMinFilter.LinearMipmapLinear);\n\nThen, you simply call GL.GenerateMipmap and specify a texture target to generate the mipmap for. Like so:\nGL.GenerateMipmap(GenerateMipmapTarget.Texture2D);\n\nAnd thats all there is to it. Mip mapping is now enabled, and mip-maps are now generated. But just to be compleate, let&#39;s take a look at loading a full texture with mip-mapping:\nint textureHandle = GL.GenTexture();\nGL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, textureHandle);\n\n// Enable mip mapping here, with the min filter\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, (int)TextureMinFilter.LinearMipmapLinear);\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMagFilter, (int)TextureMagFilter);\n\nBitmap bmp = new Bitmap(&quot;SomeImageFile.png&quot;);\nBitmapData bmp_data = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);\n\nGL.TexImage2D(TextureTarget.Texture2D, 0, PixelInternalFormat.Rgba, bmp_data.Width, bmp_data.Height, 0, OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.PixelFormat.Bgra, PixelType.UnsignedByte, bmp_data.Scan0);\n// Generate mipmap here, after pixel data is uploaded to GPU\nGL.GenerateMipmap(GenerateMipmapTarget.Texture2D);\n\nbmp.UnlockBits(bmp_data);\nbmp.Dispose();\n\nThere is a decent example of this code being used on the Official OpenTK website\n"},"Chapter7/TexParams.html":{"url":"Chapter7/TexParams.html","title":"Texture Paramaters","body":"Texture Paramaters\nYou can tell OpenGL how to treat different properties of textures using the GL.TexParameter function. We&#39;ve already used the function when telling OpenGL how to handle the min and mag filters for the textures being loaded.

So what is texture wrapping?\nWe&#39;ve seen what happens when you have a quad which is mapped within the 0 to 1 uv range, like so:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 1);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(left, bottom, 0.0f); // Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 1);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(right, bottom, 0.0f);// Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 0);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(right, top, 0.0f);   // Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 0);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(left, top, 0.0f);    // Where on screen to draw it\nGL.End();\nBut what happens if you exceed that range? For instance, what if your texture coords dont go to one, but they go to 2... Or -7. Like this:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 3);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(left, bottom, 0.0f); // Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(3, 3);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(right, bottom, 0.0f);// Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(3, 0);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(right, top, 0.0f);   // Where on screen to draw it\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 0);             // What part of the texture to draw\n    GL.Vertex3(left, top, 0.0f);    // Where on screen to draw it\nGL.End();\nThis is where texture wrapping comes into play. The texture wrapping paramater tells OpenGL how to handle this exact scenario. There are 4 possible values you could set wrapping to:\n\nRepeat Will tile the texture\nMirroredRepeat Will tile the texture, with each tile being flipped\nClampToEdge Will use the edge pixel of a texture to determine the remaining colors\nClampToBorder Will use a solid border color to fill the remaining pixels\n\nThis might sound a bit confusing at first, so lets take a look at how each option acts in a real world situation\n\nYou can set different paramaters for the X and Y axis. You specify each axis as TextureParameterName.TextureWrapS for the X and TextureParameterName.TextureWrapT for the Y. For example, if you wanted to set a texture to repeat on both axis, you would use this code:\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureWrapS, (int)TextureWrapMode.Repeat);\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureWrapT, (int)TextureWrapMode.Repeat);\nThere is one more paramater you have to set if you use the ClampToBorder paramater, and that&#39;s the border color. You can set the border color like this:\nGL.TexParameter(TextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureBorderColor, new float[] { r, g, b, a});\nOn your own\nModify the sample scene we&#39;ve been working with so that the crazy taxi image is uv&#39;d from -2 to 2 instead of 0 to 1. Make sure the wrapping paramaters on both axis are set to repeat. The final image should look like this:\n\n"},"Chapter7/ui.html":{"url":"Chapter7/ui.html","title":"Textures for UI","body":"Textures for UI\nTexturing 3D objects is cool, but one of the most often used places for textures is UI. In this section i&#39;m going to walk you trough how to add ui to any scene. Then, in the on your own section you will implement some UI on top of the 3D textured test scene we&#39;ve been working with so far.\nMultiple coordinates\nUI relies on using multiple coordinates. After all, if you have a world with a perspective camera, you don&#39;t want your UI to be perspective. Unless some UI is in world space (Like the health bar of an RTS game) the UI should be in an orthographic projection.\nWe not only give the UI it&#39;s own projection matrix, we also give it it&#39;s own modelview matrix. This allows us to work easily in ui space. Generally, the code for UI will go something like this:\nvoid Render() {\n// FIRST, We render the 3D scene!\n\n    // Assume the matrix mode is ModelView\n    // Load world modelview matrix for the 3D scene\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(new Vector3(-7.0f, 5.0f, -7.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));\n    GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\n    // Render 3D scene as normal\n    RenderWorld();\n\n// THEN, render the UI\n\n    // Clear only the depth buffer. This way our UI will not z-test against\n    // the 3D scene, because the depth buffer will be empty.\n    GL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.DepthBufferBit);\n\n    // Switch to projection matrix mode, backup 3D projection, load UI projection\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection); // Switch\n    GL.PushMatrix(); // Backup\n    GL.LoadIdentity(); // Clear\n    GL.Ortho(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1); // Load UI Projection\n\n    // Switch back to modelview mode, backup 3D modelview, clear\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.ModelView); // Switch\n    GL.PushMatrix(); // Backup\n    GL.LoadIdentity(); // Clear\n\n    // Render the UI\n    RenderUI();\n\n    // Restore world (3D) projection\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection();\n    GL.Pop();\n\n    // Restore world (3D) modelview\n    GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.ModelView();\n    GL.Pop();\n\n    // We make sure the matrix mode is modelview for the next render iteration\n}\n\nThat&#39;s a LOT of code, but it kind of shows you how rendering the UI is almost an entireley different render path alltogether. It&#39;s like rendering an overlay. Perhaps the most important thing when rendering the UI is the call to clear the depth buffer:\nGL.Clear(ClearBufferMask.DepthBufferBit);\nThis call clears all Z-values that have been written into the depth buffer so far. By doing this, we ensure that our UI never clips against anything in world space. This should look familiar, a similar call is used in Program.cs to clear the depth and color bufers.\nAfter the depth buffer is cleared, we back up the world space projection and reset it to UI space, next we back up the world space view matrix and replace it with the UI view matrix. And that all there is to it, now we just render the UI.\nI STRONGLY suggest breaking your scene into two render functions, RenderWorld and RenderUI, and calling them like i did above. This will keep the main render function Render of your scene from getting unmaintanable.\nPositioning the UI\nRight now positioning the UI is a pain in the ass. Because the screen goes from -1 to 1 we have to figure out how much space a ui element takes up, then normalize that into the screen. We might end up with UI code that looks like this:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 1);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.1345f, 0.3345f, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 1);  \n    GL.Vertex3(0.435f, 0.3345f, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 0);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.435f, 0.1245f, 0.0f); \n\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 0);\n    GL.Vertex3(0.1345f, 0.1245f, 0.0f); \nGL.End();\nAnd that is kind of awefull! I mean, what if you need to change the screen position later, this becomes a nightmare to maintain. Worse yet, it does not account for aspect ration. Worse, worse yet, because of the aspect ratio error compounded with possible floating point error it&#39;s nearly impossible to get a pixel perfect UI.\nAnd that&#39;s the real issue here, sometimes we NEED for UI to be pixel perfect. Other times it doesn&#39;t matter, but if you are serious about making something 2D, you need to at least have the option of being pixel perfect.\nPixel Perfect\nThe key to a pixel perfect UI lies in the orthographic projection matrix. Right now we have the space map to NDC space, that is a cube ranging from -1 to 1, like so:\nGL.Ortho(-1, 1, -1, 1, -10, 10); // Load UI Projection\nThat maps 1 unit to half the width of the screen. What if we didn&#39;t do this? Instead we could change our orthographic space to map 1 unit to 1 pixel? Can we even do this? Yes, yes we can, like so:\nint screenWidth = MainGameWindow.Window.Width;\nint screenHeight = MainGameWindow.Window.Height;\n// Ortho: left, right, bottom, top, near, far\nGL.Ortho(0, screenWidth, screenHeight, 0, -1, 1);\n\nNow the left of the screen is at 0, the right is at screenWidth units. This makes our orthographic projection space map 1 to 1 with pixels, meaning if we want a quad to render in the top left, 10 pixels from the top, 15 pixels from the left 20 pixels wide and 30 pixels tall, we could just do this:\nint left = 15; // Left is 15 pixels from edge of screen\nint top = 10; // Top is 10 pixels from edge of screen\nint right = 15 + 20; // 20 pixels wide, right side is left + 20\nint bottom = 10 + 30; // 30 pixels tall, bottom is top + 30\n\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Quads);\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 1); \n    GL.Vertex3(left, bottom, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 1);  \n    GL.Vertex3(right, bottom, 0.0f);\n\n    GL.TexCoord2(1, 0);   \n    GL.Vertex3(right, top, 0.0f); \n\n    GL.TexCoord2(0, 0);    \n    GL.Vertex3(left, top, 0.0f);  \nGL.End();\nAnd that&#39;s that. We just defined a texture to be drawn using pixel coordinates. All because the orthographic projection matrix mapped the projections NDC space 1 to 1 with our windows pixel space. \nWhat if you wanted that same quad to be 15 pixels from the right of the screen instead of the left?\nint quadWidth = 20;\nint right = screenWidth - 15; // Place right side of quad 15 pixels from width of screen\nint left = right - quadWidth; // Place left side of quad 20 pixels from right side of quad\n\n// Top and bottom like normal\n// Draw like normal\n\nThe point is, once you are in pixel space, you can figure out how to anchor UI to different parts of a window\nUtility\nI suggest writing a utility function. Something along the lines of \nvoid DrawTexture(int texId, Rect screenRect, Rect sourceRect, Size sourceImageSize) {\n    // TODO, figure out how to render quad to screen\n}\n\nThis way, you won&#39;t have to write the above verbose GL.Begin / GL.End every time you want to render a ui quad. Also, it will make your life super easy if your projection is pixel perfect. \nTry to write the function on your own, maybe load some UI texture to test it with. If you want you can send it to me for review before doing the &quot;On Your Own&quot; section. The Primitives class might be a good place for this function to live.\n"},"Chapter7/ui_practice.html":{"url":"Chapter7/ui_practice.html","title":"On your own","body":"Implementing a simple UI\nWe&#39;re going to modify the demo scene we&#39;ve been working with to have a simple UI. I suggest reading this whole page over at least one time before implementing any code, just so you have an idea of everything that will be happening. \nIf you want to write or use some helper functions for this example, that&#39;s fine. By the time we&#39;re done, the demo scene will look like this:\n\nFirst, download the following texture into your assets directory:\n\nThe first thing you want to do is make a RenderUI function. You can leave it blank for now, just have it stubbed in. This is where to code to render your UI will go.\n\nAdd a new integer variable to the class to hold the UI\nIn initialize, load the UI texture\nRemember to unload it in shutdown\n\n\nRefactor your render function into a RenderWorld function\nThat is, render should set the modelview matrix\nThen call RenderWorld\n\n\nAfter the world is rendered:\nSet a pixel perfect Orthographic projection matrix\nRemember, back up the old one\n\n\nLoad identity for the view matrix\nRemember, back up the old one\n\n\nCall your RenderUI function\nRestore the projection and view matrices\n\n\n\nRunning your game at this point, everything should render as it did before. It&#39;s a really good place to check and make sure nothing is broken yet. After you&#39;ve confirmed that nothing is broken, it&#39;s time to start working on the actual UI.\n\nFirst, clear your depth buffer!\nMake sure the right texture is bound\nRender the health-bar on screen.\nScreen coordinates (in pixels):\nX: 10\nY: 10\nW: 210\nH: 43\n\n\nUV Coordinates (in pixels):\nX: 2\nY: 2\nW: 421\nH: 87\n\n\nYou can either figure out the normalized UV position by hand\nOr normalize it in code, all you need is the texture width / height\n\n\nThe 3 buttons need to be rendered independently,\nAll 3 buttons should be Relative to the bottom right corner\nWhen the window is resized, these stay the same distance from the corner \n\n\nThe spacing between buttons is 10 pixels\n\n\nRender facebook button on screen\nUV Coordinates: Written on texture\nScreen Coordinates:\nBottom: 10 pixels above the window bottom \nTop: The height of the button above &quot;Bottom&quot;\nRight: 10 pixels from the right of the window\nLeft: the width of the button to the right of &quot;Right&quot;\n\n\n\n\nRender help button on screen\nUV Coordinates: Written on texture\nScreen Coordinates:\nBottom: 10 pixels above the window bottom \nTop: The height of the button above &quot;Bottom&quot;\nRight: 10 pixels from the right of facebook buttons &quot;Left&quot;\nLeft: the width of the button to the right of &quot;Right&quot;\n\n\n\n\nRender home button on screen\nUV Coordinates: Written on texture\nScreen Coordinates:\nBottom: 10 pixels above the window bottom \nTop: The height of the button above &quot;Bottom&quot;\nRight: 10 pixels from the right of help buttons &quot;Left&quot;\nLeft: the width of the button to the right of &quot;Right&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nHint, not seeing anything on screen? Try GL.Disable(EnableCap.CullFace) to see if your UI rect&#39;s are being culled improperly. Keeping cull face disabled is not an option, but it&#39;s a debug step towards seeing what is broken.\nWhen resizing the screen, the health bar is relative to the top left. This is why you could just do screen coordinates. But when you render the buttons in the bottom right, they need to move with the screen size. So you need to adjust their X-Y coordinates accordingly.\nFor example:\nint buttonSpace = 10;\nint homeButtonX = screen.Width - buttonSpace - home.Width;\nint helpButtonX = homeButtonX - buttonSpace - help.Width;\nint fbButtonX = helpButtonX - buttonSpace - fb.Width;\n\n"},"Chapter7/sorting.html":{"url":"Chapter7/sorting.html","title":"Sorting Objects","body":"Sorting\nSo far we&#39;ve been writing all of this rendering code inline, that is whenever we needed to render anything, we just do! The only thing we really wrapped into an object has been the grid. And maybe a &quot;Draw Texture&quot; function.\nRendering a 3D game will get complex. A 3D mixes and matches solid and transparent objects sometimes. In order to draw transparent objects, you must first draw solid objects, then draw transparent objects. Transparent objects need to be sorted based on who is furthest from the camera.\nI&#39;ll walk you trough how it would normally work. This is not something you need to implement right now, but it is something to be aware of, as you might need to do this at some point.\nTransparent objects\nWhen reading this remember, you can render solid objects in any order. The Z-Buffer will make sure that objects get rendered correctly.\nGame Objects only need to be sorted when they are rendered with transperancy! And even then, it&#39;s advised to render in two passes. First, render the solid objects, next render the transparent ones.\nThe Component (and render component)\nWe&#39;re going to use a fairly simple component base class\nclass Component {\n    GameObject owner;\n\n    public virtual void Render() { }\n    public virtual void Update(float deltaTime) { }\n}\n\nAnd the render component is going to be pretty simple too. It will however need to do some logic to see if a model is textured, or has normals.\nclass MeshRenderer : Component {\n    public int textureHandle;\n    public bool UsingAlpha; // Set if object is transparent\n\n    protected List&lt;Vector3&gt; vertices;\n    protected List&lt;Vector3&gt; normals;\n    protected List&lt;Vector2&gt; uvs;\n\n    public override void Render() {\n        // Enable texturing if we use it\n        if (textureHandle != -1) {\n            GL.Enable(EnableCaps.Texture2D);\n        }\n\n        GL.Begin(PrimitiveType.Triangles);\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; vertices.Count; ++i) {\n                if (normals != null) {\n                    GL.Normal3(normals[i].x, normals[i].y, normals[i].z);\n                }\n\n                if (uvs != null &amp;&amp; textureHandle != -1) {\n                    GL.TexCoord2(uvs[i].x, uvs[i].y);\n                }\n\n                GL.Vertex3(vertices[i].x, vertices[i].y, vertices[i].z);\n            }\n        GL.End();\n\n        // Disable texturing if it was enabled\n        if (textureHandle != -1) {\n            GL.Disable(EnableCaps.Texture2D);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe Game Object\nFor this example, let&#39;s assume we have a super simple 3D game object class. The class is going to be super minimal for this example, it&#39;s going to have a list of components, a list of children, a potential parent and a 3D transform (a matrix).\nclass GameObject {\n    public string Name;\n    public List&lt;Component&gt; Components;\n    public GameObject Parent;\n    public List&lt;GameObject&gt; Children;\n    public Matrix4 LocalTransform;\n\n    public Matrix4 WorldTransform {\n        get {\n            // The order of this multiplication might be wrong\n            return LocalTransform * Parent.LocalTransform;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Update(float deltaTime) {\n        foreach (Component component in Components) {\n            component.Update(deltaTime);\n        }\n        foreach(GameObject child in Children) {\n            child.Update(deltaTime);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void RenderSolid() {\n        foreach (Component component in Components) {\n            if (component is MeshRenderer) {\n                MeshRenderer renderer = component as MeshRenderer;\n                if (!renderer.UsingAlpha) {\n                    // Backup view matrix\n                    GL.PushMatrix();\n\n                    // Apply game object transform\n                    GL.MulMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(WorldTransform).Matrix);\n\n                    // Render the object\n                    component.Render();\n\n                    // Restore view matrix\n                    GL.PopMatrix();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        foreach(GameObject child in Children) {\n            child.RenderSolid();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe Scene\nThe scene class, is going to for the most part be what we are used to, a root game object, that in turn has many children. The update function is actually going to be recursive, like we are used to. One thing that&#39;s different in this scene is it&#39;s going to have a view matrix defined. This is essentially the camera. \nRemember, you can get the world position of the camera (the viewer) by taking the inverse of the view matrix. And you can get the view matrix by taking the inverse of the world position of the camera matrix.\nclass Scene {\n    public string Name;\n    public GameObject Root;\n    public Matrix View;\n\n    public void Update(float deltaTime) {\n        if (Root != null) {\n            Root.Update(deltaTime);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Render() {\n        // load the view matrix\n        GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(View).Matrix);\n\n        if (Root != null) {\n            // Each object will load it&#39;s own model matrix\n            Root.RenderSolid();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis will render all solid objects in the scene. Now, let&#39;s see what we need to do to render transparent objects!\nRendering transparent objects\nIn order to render transparent objects, we have to do a 2 step process. First, we need to collect all transparent object. Then, we need to sort them based on distance to camera. I&#39;m going to make a new class (a protected helper of scene) and create a method to collect all transparent objects\nclass Scene {\n    protected class RenderCommand {\n        MeshRenderer component;\n        Matrix worldTransform;\n        float DistanceToCamera;\n\n        public void Execute() {\n            // Backup view matrix\n            GL.PushMatrix();\n\n            // Apply game object transform\n            GL.MulMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(worldTransform).Matrix);\n            // Render component\n            component.Render();\n\n            // Restore view matrix\n            GL.PopMatrix();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public string Name;\n    public GameObject Root;\n    public Matrix View;\n\n    public void Update(float deltaTime) {\n        if (Root != null) {\n            Root.Update(deltaTime);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Render() {\n        // load the view matrix\n        GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(View).Matrix);\n\n        if (Root != null) {\n            // Each object will load it&#39;s own model matrix\n            Root.RenderSolid();\n        }\n\n        // Collect transparent objects\n        List&lt;RenderCommand&gt; transparentObjects = CollectTransparent(Root);\n\n        // Sort the transparent objects back to front\n        SortList(transparentObjects);\n\n        // Finally, render all transparent objects, back to front\n        foreach (RenderCommand command in transparentObjects) {\n            command.Execute();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void SortList(List&lt;RenderCommand&gt; list) {\n        // Implement bubble sort, \n        // sort the list using the DistanceToCamera field\n        // of each RenderCommand\n    }\n\n    List&lt;RenderCommand&gt; CollectTransparent(GameObject object) {\n        List&lt;RenderCommand&gt; result = new List&lt;RenderCommand&gt;();\n\n        foreach(Component component in object.Components) {\n            if (component is MeshRenderer) {\n                MeshRenderer renderer = component as MeshRenderer;\n\n                if (renderer.UsingAlpha) {\n                    RenderCommand command = new RenderCommand();\n                    command.component = renderer;\n                    command.worldTransform = object.WorldTransform;\n\n                    // Find the distance to camera. We do this by taking two points at 0, 0, 0\n                    // Next transform one point to where the camera is\n                    // and the other point to where the game obejct is\n                    // With the transformed vectors, check their difference\n\n                    Vector3 cam = Matrix4.Inverse(View) * new Vector3(0, 0, 0);\n                    Vector3 obj = object.WorldTransform * Vector3(0, 0, 0);\n                    command.DistanceToCamera = Vector3.Length(cam - obj);\n\n                    result.Add(command);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        foreach(GameObject child in object) {\n            List&lt;RenderCommand&gt; childRenderers = CollectTransparent(child);\n            if (childRenderers != null &amp;&amp; childRenderers.Count &gt; 0) {\n                result.AddRange(childRenderers);\n            }\n        }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n\nIt&#39;s a lot of code, but our renderer finally has a list of transparent objects. Instead of storing GameObjects i made a helper calss called RenderCommand. We could have just stored objects, then found the render component on those objects later when it&#39;s time to draw them, but this is slightly more efficient.\nRender commands are also pretty standard in 3D games. Usually even solid objects get grouped into a set of render commands, they are not sorted; but commands only get created for objects that the camera can see. We will talk about this more in detail later.\nOnce we have a list of render commands, you need to sort them based on distance to camera. You can use whatever sort you like. Then, in the correct back to front order, render all the game objects.\n"},"Chapter10/":{"url":"Chapter10/","title":"Particles","body":"Particles\nEverything is better with particles! Case and point, watch this video. \nExplosions, sparks, underwater bubbles, other special fx, particle systems in modern games are used to add eye-candy to a game. Usually indevidual particles have no collision reaction, there are just too many of them. But some sort of generic sphere collider could encapsulate the entire particle system.\nParticles in effect are a number of entities that behave according to some pre-defined rules. Take rain for example. Each rain drop is a particle, all drops behave according to gravity. That is, a cloud spawns rain particles, they fall down with gravity. When a rain drop entity hits the ground it dies (is recycled as a different drop).\nA more formal definition: A particle system is a collection of any number of entities, either related or unrelated, that behave according to a set of logical rules, (a system).\nSee, the concept of a particle system is rather abstract. Any number of things will fit into that description, the roads of GTA, the speckles of a screensaver, rain... This is what makes particles so hard for most programmers. Two games can both have particle systems, and the implementation can be compelatly different. \nWhen it comes to particles all we care about is what the final image looks like. Do these entitites acting under some system look the way we expect / want? If so, the particle system works. If not, it just needs some additional work.\n&quot;We don&#39;t try to model the outcome of the system, we try to model the system and see its outcome&quot; - Andre LaMothe\n"},"Chapter10/contepts.html":{"url":"Chapter10/contepts.html","title":"Design","body":"Design\nLet&#39;s design a particle system. In general there are two ways to go about this. You can either design a base &quot;ParticleSystem&quot; class and then extend it into specific sub classes such as &quot;FireParticles&quot; or &quot;SnowParticles&quot; OR you can make a single mega particle system that exposes all sorts of properties such as absolute and relative velocity, then tweek these until your system is the way you want it.\nAs always, there is no right or wrong answer, what you use depends on what your needs are. Unity for example goes with the second route, the mega particle system. This is because they want the particles to be editable easily from the editor without code.\nWe on the other hand are not going to be shy about getting our hands dirty. We are going to design a particle system using the first approach. Where each new effect will take a little bit of code to create.\nLets take a bit of time and talk about things a particle system might need. Not everything we talk about on this page will make it into our implementation. Some of the stuff will be just for the purpose of discussion.\n"},"Chapter10/particles.html":{"url":"Chapter10/particles.html","title":"Particles","body":"Particles\nLets start at the most basic element, the indevidual particle. To begin, you ned to decide what attributes a particle is going to need. Possible attributes might include:\n\nPosition\nVelocity\nLife Span\nSize\nWeight\nRepresentation\nColor\nOwner\n\nThere are of course many other attributes you may want to try out, but these are the basics. When designing a particle system it&#39;s important to know to assign attributes that affect indevidual particles to the particle class, but attributes that effect all particles to the particle system class. Let&#39;s take a look at each of the above attributes in a little bit more detail. \nPosition\nYou need to know where the particle is in 3D space so that you can render it correctly. This is an attribute that will almost certainly belong to the particle, not the partcle system. You may also want to track the particles last position to achieve effects such as trails. Note that the particles position will be affected by velocity.\nVelocity\nYour particles are probably going to be moving, so you need to store their velocity. It&#39;s most convenient to store this as a vector representing both speed and direction so you can use the vector to update the particles position.\nVelocity will likely be affected by such factors as wind and gravity which we&#39;ll discuss later in this chapter, in the &quot;Forces&quot; subsection under &quot;Particle Systems&quot;. If the particle is capable of accelerating itself, that could affect the velocity as well, and you&#39;d want to create an additional vector to store the acceleration. More often tough, the factors that affect the velocity of a particle are external.\nLife Span\nFor most effects, particles are going to be emitted from their source, and after some period of time are going to disappear. For this reason, you need to either keep track of how long a particle has been alive, or how long it has left to live. The life span may affect other attributes as a particle might grow, shrink or fade over time.\nSize\nSize in an attribute that may not need to be handled by indevidual particles. In fact, unless the size changes based on something, it&#39;s a useless attribute! However you might want to increase the size of particles, for example to represent a large fire, then decrease them as the fire dwindles. \nWeight\nWeight is a lot like size in terms of weather it&#39;s needed as an attribute or not. If a particle might accelerate differently based on weight, or if it is affected by gravity differently you should include weight. Otherwise it&#39;s useless.\nRepresentation\nTo have particles produce some kind of effect, you&#39;re going to have to see them. The real question is, how are you going to represent them on screen? There are three commonly used methods, tough you may find other ways to represent them depending on your needs. The most common representations are:\n\nPoints Points can be used for a number of effects, especially those that arn&#39;t viewed closely. Each particle might be a 3D point.\nLines These can be used to create a trailing effect, which is often useful. The line connects the particles current position and it&#39;s last one. Often used for rain\nTextured Quads This offers the most flexibility, and is the most widley used method. The particles its self is a quad or a triangle, and has a (possibly alpha blended) texture on it. Fire, sparks, smoke all use this method.\n\nNote, if you decide to use quads, it&#39;s a good idea to use billboarding to amke them always face the camera. Billboarding will be covered two chapters from now, under the &quot;Advanced Topics&quot; section.\nColor\nIf you choose the point or line representation discussed in the preceeding section you will probably want each particle to have a color. Even if you are using textured quads, a color tint might be a good idea. Color may change over time.\nOwner\nSometimes particles benefit from knowing what particle system owns them. That way they can call methods in their owner system. \n"},"Chapter10/system.html":{"url":"Chapter10/system.html","title":"Particle Systems","body":"Particle Systems\nParticles are owned by a particle system. Each particle system will control a set of particles, each of which acts atonomously, but share some common attributes. It&#39;s the job of the particle system to assign these attributes in such a way that, collectivley, the particles create a desired effect. Some of the things a particle system might handle include:\n\nPartcle list\nPosition\nEmission Rate\nForces\nDefault particle attributes and ranges\nCurrent state\nBlending\nRepresentation\n\nJust like with the discussion of particles, not everything we discuss about particle systems here will be implemented in our demo. And when you design your own particle systems, you might opt to include more attributes than the ones listed here. With that being said, let&#39;s go trough each attribute:\nParticle List\nFirst and foremost, the system needs to be able to access the particles it is managing. So it needs a list of them, often stored as an array. The particle system should also have some maximum number of particles that it is allowed to create, effectivley defining the size of the array.\nPosition\nThe particle system must be located somewhere to determine where particles start. Altough this is usually modelled as a single point in space (For example, a campfire), but they don&#39;t have to be. You could represent the position of a system as a rectangle, so particles can be emitted randomly within that space (For example, rain), which would make the rectangle the part of the sky that is raining.\nEmission Rate\nThe emission rate determines how often a new particle is created. To maintain a regular emission rate, the system will also need to keep track of how long it&#39;s been since the last particle was emitted.\nForces\nAdding one or more forces to a particle system can create a greater degree of realism, or lack thereof. Forces can range anywhere from graivty, gravity wells to exploding forces and torque.\nDefault particle attributes and ranges\nWhen a system creates a new particle, it should do so with some default attribtues. For certain systems, having each particle spawn the same size will work perfectly. Other systems might need a default range. That is any particle might spawn between a range of 2 and 4 in terms of size. Wether your system uses default attribtues or ranges depends on the effect you want to create.\nCurrent State\nYou might want your particle system to change its behaviour over time; this may simply involve turning a system on or off. For example, a snow particle system should be off during summer.This is essentially enabling / disabling the system.\nSometimes you want to manually turn the system on or off, but other times you might want to have the system turn off on it&#39;s own after some time. An explosion would be a great example of this.\nBlending\nMost particle systems use some sort of blending. For this reason you might want to include source and destination blend paramaters as attirbutes of the particle system. Then again, most systems will make due with the default alpha blending, in which case this attribute is useless.\nRepresentation\nIn most cases all particles within a system are going to be represented the same way. Because of this you might want to store a particles representation as a system attribute, instead of as an indevidual particle attribtue.\n"},"Chapter10/impl.html":{"url":"Chapter10/impl.html","title":"Implementation","body":"Implementation\nNow that we have talked a bit about how particle systems work, let&#39;s go ahead and actually implement one. I&#39;ll get you started by walking you trough the base classes needed to create particles.

This is because of where we will position the snow&#39;s draw call.\n"},"Chapter10/im_particle.html":{"url":"Chapter10/im_particle.html","title":"Particle","body":"Particle Class\nLet&#39;s start by making a particle class. We&#39;re going to include a small number of attributes in this class. We&#39;re also going to include two unused attributes. The idea behind the unused atributes is to demonstrate that not all systems use the same attributes.\nFor example, if we have a snow particle system and a fire particle system they will both utilize the same particle class. The fire system might use attributes that the snow system doesn&#39;t and visa versa. If there are extra, unused variables in this class, it&#39;s not a problem.\nThe other thing to note about this class is that it has no methods. It&#39;s a class strictly to hold data. I&#39;ve decided that my particle systems are going to know how to render each particle, so i gave the responsibility to render and update the particles to the system. This makes the partcile class super simple.\nusing Math_Implementation;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class Particle {\n        // These are used in our demo\n        public Vector3 position = new Vector3();\n        public Vector3 velocity = new Vector3();\n        public float size = 0f;\n\n        // Unused in our demo, might be nice for other systems\n        public float[] color = new float[4];\n    }\n}\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to it. The position variable is used to determine where to render the particle. The velocity variable determines how the particle will travel. The size variable sets the size of the particle. \nThe color variable is not going to be used in our demo, but other systems might need it. You should add attributes to the particle class every time a specific system needs them!\n"},"Chapter10/impl_system.html":{"url":"Chapter10/impl_system.html","title":"Particle System","body":"Particle System\nThe ParticleSystem class is a base class. It will need to be subclassed for each type of particle effect that your game might need. I included a minimum number of common attributes that you might need, more might be added as necesary.\nWe start off by declaring some member variables. We&#39;re going to need a list to store all the particles in the system. We&#39;re going to need to know the maximum number of particles the system will be able to hold as well as how many are currently alive. It also helps to know where in 3D space the system is. Becuse of how the particles are going to be spawned, let&#39;s keep track of how long the system has been alive.

It takes two arguments and sets all the class member variables accordingly.

Because each particle effect might behave differently, they will all need to override these functions. There is the standard update and render functions. The Shutdown function should be used in case the constructor loads a texture or something.\nThe interesting function here is InitParticle. This function is responsible for taking an unused particle and initalizing it with some semi random values. This will of course need to be overridden.\nBecause all the particles we have are stored in a list, the InitParticle function just needs an index into that list. It will intialize the appropriate variables.\n        public virtual void Update(float deltaTime) { }\n        public virtual void Render() { }\n        public virtual void Shutdown() { }\n\n        public virtual void InitParticle(int index) {\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;ParticleSystem.InitParticle should never be called directly&quot;);\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Only subclasses should call this function!&quot;);\n        }\n\nWe&#39;re going to use a function called Emit to actually spawn particles. When you call emit you pass in a number, the number of particles that you would like spawned. Emit will return an integer, representing how many particles it failed to spawn. With any luck the return number should be 0.\nParticles might or might not start out with some randomized values. For this reason when a particle is created we call the InitParticle function on it. That function will ensure that the particle starts out right.\n        public int Emit(int request) {\n            // If we can make particles, make them!\n            while (resuest &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (numParticles &lt; maxParticles)) {\n                // Initialize a particle, and increase the number of particles \n                InitParticle(numParticles++);\n                // Decrease particles left to spawn\n                --request;\n            }\n\n            // Return how many particles we could not create. Ideally, should be 0\n            return request;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to the particle system. It&#39;s a base class, so a lot of the effect related heavy lifting is going to be done by child classes.

First thing is first, add a new SnowstormParticleSystem member variable, set it to null by default. I called mine snow\nIn initialize, set the particle system to a new system. Use the below values.\nsnow = new SnowstormParticleSystem(5000, new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f), new Vector3(10f, 10f, 10f));\n\nCall the particle systems shutdown function in the scene shutdown.\nIn the scene render, after the world is rendered, but before anything else happens, render the particle system:\nRenderWorld();\nsnow.Render();\n\nThe particle system also needs to be updated. This means you will have to override the scenes update function, and call the particle systems update function in it. When all is done, wait a few seconds in your scene for all the snow to spawn. The final scene should look like this:\n\nOf course from this scene it&#39;s obvious that i&#39;m not an artist . Usually a technical artist will play around with a particle systems attributes to create the desired effects.\nOther systems\nOther particle systems like fire and lighting are done in similar fashions.

This method is  refered to as Immediate Mode Rendering.  Immediate mode is useful for simple applications and to prototype code, as it is easy to understand and visualize. However it comes with some performance penalties that make it less useful for applications that need to render lots of geometry at a high framerate, like games.\nFor example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re rendering a model containing 2,000 lit and textured triangles using immediate mode. Assume that you&#39;re able to pack all of the vertex data into a single triangle strip (This is the best case scenario, it&#39;s often not possible). Your rendering code might look like this:\nGL.Begin(PrimitiveType.TriangleStrip);\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 2002; ++i) { // 2002 because of the triangle STRIP\n  GL.Normal3(normals[i][0], normals[i][1], normals[i][2]);\n  GL.TexCoord2(uvs[i][0], uvs[i][1]);\n  GL.Vertex3(verts[i][0], verts[i][1], verts[i][2]);\n}\n\nGL.End();\n\nThere are several problems here, the first of which is that in order to render this model we make over 6000 function calls!

Remember, no function call is free! \nThe second and third problems are illustrated in this image:\n\nAssuming that this mesh is made up of triangle strips (perhaps it&#39;s a portion of the mesh created in pseudo-code above), each circled vertex is redundant. In other words, these vertices are shared by more than 3 triangles, but since a triangle strip can represent at most three triangles per vertex, each of the circled vertices have to be sent to the graphics card more than once.\nThis results in additional bandwith when uploading data to the video card. More importantly, those vertices will need to be transformed and lit multiple times, once for each duplicate vertex.\nTo address these issues OpenGL provides vertex arrays. A Vertex array has the following advantages:\n\nLarge batches of data can be sent with a small number of function calls. \nUsing vertex arrays we could reduce the above example from 6000 function calls to 2\n\n\nThrough the use of indexed vertex arrays, vertices can be sent exactly once per triangle mesh, reducing bandwith and lighting calculations\nThis is the reason 90% of the things we render are triangles, not quads or triangle strips\nWhen rendered with indexed arrays we can avoid sending duplicate data\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s important to understand how Vertex Arrays work, as they are the next logical step from immediate mode vertex rendering. This does not mean that they are the BEST option to render, but they are important to understand.\nNo professional game ships with immediate mode, vertex arrays used to be the goto solution, you could actually ship a game using vertex arrays (I have). Now that we&#39;ve discussed the reasons for using vertex arrays, let&#39;s see how they are used. \n"},"Chapter8/va_p1.html":{"url":"Chapter8/va_p1.html","title":"Array Based Data","body":"Array based data\nThe biggest challenge for graphics is getting data. So far we&#39;ve used simple primitives like cubes and planes. These are easy to describe directly in code using GL.Vertex3. Complicated models however will not be easily described in code.\nMost games use two approaches to solve this. First, it&#39;s possible to generate gemetric data procedurally. This just entails running some algorithm that will eventually spit out vertices to 3D geometry. We render the spehere in our demos using this method.\nMore often than not tough, geometric data will be loaded from an external file. Later on we will actually discuss how to load complex 3D models from an OBJ file. There are standard model formats out there, like OBJ, FBX and DAE but most games use some custom format. This custom format tends to be one that simply makes sense to the programmers.ctials, or a sphere.\nWhichever approach is used, it should be fairly obvious that you don&#39;t want to repeat all the work every frame. You certainly dont want to be constantly loading or generating a model. Instead you want to load the data into arrays in initialize, and then just use those arrays in the render function. \nThis is the point of vertex arrays, the data is stored in LARGE floating point arrays. Perhaps arrays of 2 to 6 thousand elements.\n"},"Chapter8/va_p2.html":{"url":"Chapter8/va_p2.html","title":"Enabling Vertex Arrays","body":"Enabling vertex arrays\nLike most OpenGL features, to be able to use vertex arrays, you must first enable them. You might expect this to be done with GL.Enable, but it&#39;s not. OpenGL provides a seperate pair of functions to control vertex array support:\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap stateArray);\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap stateArray);\n\nThe stateArray parameter is a flag indicating which type of array you&#39;re enabling (or disabling). Each type of vertex attribute (position, normal, color, uv) can be stored in an array, you need to enable whichever attributes you are using indevidually. These are the valid flags:\n\nArrayCap.VertexArray Enables an array containing the position of each verted\nArrayCap.NormalArray Enables an array containing the normal of each vertex\nArrayCap.ColorArray Enables an array containing color information for each vertex\nArrayCap.SecondaryColorArray Enables an array containing color information for each vertex\nArrayCap.IndexArray Enabled an array containing indices into a color pallete for each vertex\nArrayCap.TextureCoordArray Enabled an array containing the uv coordinates for each vertex\nArrayCap.EdgeFlagArray Enables an array containing an edge flag for each vertex\n\nFor example, if you wanted to render a model that has vertex positions, normals and texture coordinates,you&#39;d have to do the following:\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.NormalArray);\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.TextureCoordArray);\n\n// TODO: Render\n\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.TextureCoordArray);\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.NormalArray);\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n\n"},"Chapter8/va_p3.html":{"url":"Chapter8/va_p3.html","title":"Working With Arrays","body":"Working with arrays\nAfter you have enabled the array types that you will be using, the next step is to give OpenGL some data to work with. It&#39;s up to you to create arrays and fill them with the data you will be using. After you have filled the arrays with data, you need to tell OpenGL about these arrays so it can draw them. The function used to do this depends on the type of array you&#39;re using, let&#39;s look at each function in detail:\nIn each of the following functions, stride indicates the byte offset between array elements. If the array is tightly packed (meaning there is no padding between elements) you can set this to 0. Otherwise, you use the stride to compensate for padding, or to pack data for multiple attributes into a single array. \nA tightly packed array of two vertices may look like this:\nfloat[] verts = new float[] {\n  3f, 2f, 1f,\n  9f, 5f, 6f\n}\n\nThere is no padding between verices in the above array. Therefore the stride of that array is 0. But we could use a single array to hold both vertices and normals, like this:\nfloat[] modelData = new float[] {\n  3f, 2f, 1f, // VERTEX 1\n  0f, 1f, 0f, // NORMAL 1\n  9f, 5f, 6f, // VERTEX 2\n  0f, 1f, 0f  // NORMAL 2\n}\n\nIn the above example vertex 1 and vertex 2 are seperated by 6 floating point numbers. Similarly Normal 1 and Normal 2 are also seperated by 6 numbers. Therefore, the stride of the above array is 6 * sizeof(float)\nThe datatype of the array (float, int short, etc...) is indicated by type.\ndata is an array of floating points. While it is possible to use strides, i suggest having a speparate array for each data type. If your model has 4 triangles, and is renders as a PrimitiveType.Triangles primitive, this array will have 4 * 3 floats. 4 because you are rendering 4 triangles, 3 because each traingle has 3 vertices. \nOther paramaters will be explained as they are used in the functions.\nvoid GL.VertexPointer(int size, VertexPointerType type, int stride, float[] data);\n\nThis array contains positional data for vertices. size is the number of coordinates per vertex, it must be 2, 3, or 4. The above example has 3 floats for every vetex, so it&#39;s size is 3. type can be Short, Int, Float or Double.\nvoid GL.TexCoordPointer(int size, TexCoordPointerType type, int stride, float[] data);\n\nThis array contains texture coordinates for each vertex. size is the number of coordinates, it must be 1, 2, 3 or 4. type can be Short, Int, Float or Double.\nvoid GL.NormalPointer(NormalPointerType type, int stride, float[] data);\n\nThis array contains normal vectors for each vertex. Normals are always stored with exactly 3 coordinates (x, y, z) so there is no size paramater. type can be Byte, Short, Int, Float or Double.\nvoid GL.ColorPointer(int size, ColorPointerType type, int stride, float[] data);\n\nThis specifies the primary color array (vertex color). size is the number of components per color, which is either 3 or 4 (RGB or RGBA). type can be Byte, UnsignedByte, Short, UnsignedShort, Int, UnsignedInt, Float or Double.\nAfter having specified which arrays OpenGL should use for each vertex attribute, you can begin to have it access the data for rendering. There are several functions you can render with, next we will talk about each of them.\n"},"Chapter8/va_p4.html":{"url":"Chapter8/va_p4.html","title":"Pinning and Pointers","body":"Pinning\nThe following section is copied from This article, which explains how vertex arrays should be used. This page also provides some very usable information on rendering in OpenTK.\nYou don&#39;t have to store data in linear arrays. So long as your data is laid out linearly, you can use pointers to access it as if it where arrays. If you want to use strides within your arrays, that is have all vertex data in a large array instaed of having a color and a position array, you have to use pointers\nAdvanced\nYou will NOT need to do this if you just store your vertex data in linear array. This is actually super advanced, but i figured i&#39;d dedicate a page to it for the sake of completeness.\nVertex Arrays use client storage, because they are stored in system memory (not video memory). Since .Net is a Garbage Collected environment, the arrays must remain pinned until the GL.DrawArrays() or GL.DrawElements() call is complete.\nPinning an array means that while the array is pinned the garbage collector is not allowed to touch it. If the arrays are unpinned prematurely, they may be moved or collected by the Garbage Collector before the draw call finishes. This will lead to random access violation exceptions and corrupted rendering, issues which can be difficult to trace.\nDue to the asynchronous nature of OpenGL, GL.Finish() must be used to ensure that rendering is complete before the arrays are unpinned. Let&#39;s take a look at how this might be used in context:\nstruct Vertex {\n    public Vector3 Position;\n    public Vector2 TexCoord;\n}\n// Vertex size = 5 * sizeof(float)\n\nVertex[] vertices = new Vertex[100];\n\nunsafe { // MUST BE CALLED TO ACCESS POINTERS\n    fixed (float* pvertices = vertices) { // Pins memory\n        GL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 5 * sizeof(float), pvertices);\n        GL.TexCoordPointer(2, VertexPointerType.Float, 5 * sizeof(float), pvertices + sizeof(Vector3));\n        GL.DrawArrays(BeginMode.Triangles, 0, vertices.Length); // Discussed in next section\n        GL.Finish();    // Force OpenGL to finish rendering while the arrays are still pinned.\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that all of the code is wrapped in an unsafe section. In order to use pointers you must tell C# that the code you are using is going to be touching memory directly, since this is considered risky business in the C# world we put all such code in an unsafe block.\nThe fixed keyword will pin memory to the desired variable until the fixed block is exited. A pointer datatype is denoted by adding an asterix (*) after the variable type. So a pointer to an array bacomes float*, but a pointer to a single floating point value would also be float*. \nIn order to run unsafe code, you need to turn it on as a compiler option. You can just check the option under project settings:\n\n"},"Chapter8/va_p5.html":{"url":"Chapter8/va_p5.html","title":"DrawArrays","body":"GL.DrawArrays\nWhen this function is called, OpenGL iterates over each of the currently enabled arrays, rendering primitives as it goes. Lets take a look at the function to understand how it works:\nvoid GL.DrawArrays(PrimitiveType type, int first, int count);\n\ntype serves the same basic function as the paramater of GL.Begin. It specifies what type of primitives the vertex data creates. Valid values are: Points, LineStrip, LineLoop, Lines, TriangleStrip, TriangleFan, Triangles, QuadStrip, Quads and Polygon.\nfirst specifies the index at which we should start drawing. This means you can choose to only draw a part of the array data.\ncount is how many indices to draw. If your model has 92 vertices, this will be 92. it&#39;s the number of vertices, NOT the number of triangles. Even after 5 years, this argument still trips me up sometimes!\nIt should be noted that after calling GL.DrawArrays the state of the arrays being processed is undefined. Meaning you have to re-bind them or the behaviour of the next DrawArrays call is undefined. \nFor example, lets try to render two meshes from the same arrays. The following code is bad:\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.NormalArray);\n\nGL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, pverts);\nGL.NormalPointer(NormalPointerType.Float, 0, pnorms);\n\nGL.DrawArrays(BeginMode.Triangles, mesh1.offset, mesh1.Length); // Draw mesh 1\nGL.DrawArrays(BeginMode.Triangles, mesh2.offset, mesh2.Length); // Draw mesh 2\n\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.NormalArray);\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n\nThe proper way to render them would be like this:\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\nvoid GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.NormalArray);\n\nGL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, pverts);\nGL.NormalPointer(NormalPointerType.Float, 0, pnorms);\nGL.DrawArrays(BeginMode.Triangles, mesh1.offset, mesh1.Length); // Draw mesh 1\n\nGL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, pverts);\nGL.NormalPointer(NormalPointerType.Float, 0, pnorms);\nGL.DrawArrays(BeginMode.Triangles, mesh2.offset, mesh2.Length); // Draw mesh 2\n\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.NormalArray);\nvoid GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n\nTake note of how the VertexPointer and Normal pointers are re-defined between calls to DrawArrays\n"},"Chapter8/va_p6.html":{"url":"Chapter8/va_p6.html","title":"DrawElements","body":"GL.DrawElements\nThis function is very similar to GL.DrawArrays, but it is even more powerful! With GL.DrawArrays, your only option is to draw all vertices in the array sequentially. Meaning you can&#39;t reference the same vertex more than once. So GL.DrawArrays still has the problem of needing duplicate verts.\nGL.DrawElementson on the other hand allows you to specify the array elements in any order, and access each element (vertex) as many times as needed. Let&#39;s take a look at the function prototype:\nvoid GL.DrawElements(BeginMode mode, int count, DrawElementsType type, uint indices);\nmode and count are used the same as in GL.DrawArrays. type is the type of the valies in the indices array, it should be UnsignedByte, UnsignedShort, or UnsignedInt. indices is an array containing indexes for the vertices you want to render.\nThe last argument for GL.DrawElements is an array of unsigned integers uint[]. It could also be unsigned byte or short, depending on the type paramater.\nTo understand the value of this method, it must be reiterated that not only can you specify the indices in any order, you can also specify the same vertex repeatedly in the series. In games, most vertices will be shared by more than one polygon. By storing the vertex once and accessing it repeatedly by it&#39;s index, you can save a substantial amount of memory. \nIn addition, OpenGL will only do lighting calculations once for each vertex, this means that by re-using vertices you save on performance by not having to repeat the same computation for identical vertices.

But even vertex arrays have drawbacks. The biggest one is that vertex data lives in CPU memory. This means, that every frame when you call a function like GL.VertexPointer that memory has to be uploaded to the GPU.\nThis means not only are we paying extra performance to upload the memory every frame, for some time identical data exists in both CPU and GPU memory.\nVertex Buffer Objects fix this. A vertex buffer is simply memory that lives on the GPU, much like a texture. Using Vertex buffers is actually very similar to using textures. first you create a buffer, then you fill it with data. Now you are ready to render every frame. Once you&#39;re done, you tell OpenGL to delete the buffer.\nCode Re-Use\nThe interesting thing about vertex buffers is that they re-use 90% of the same code that array buffers use. So, even tough we have a buffer filled with data, we still need to enable vertex arrays; we just tell OpenGL that instead of using an actual array for the vertex array (VA) data, we want to use a vertex buffer object (VBO).\nThis does get a little confusing at times. Because both techniques use the same function calls, using a VBO veruses using a VA comes down to weather or not an active buffer is bound.\nIf an active buffer is bound, OpenGL assumes you want to use Vertex Buffers, otherwise it assumes you want Vertex arrays. This will become clear in the next section.\nSample\nAfter having read trough the general guide, if the process still doesn&#39;t make sense, there is a decent VBO Example on the OpenTK website.\n"},"Chapter8/vb1.html":{"url":"Chapter8/vb1.html","title":"Generate and Bind","body":"Generating a vertex buffer\nYou can generate a new vertex buffer with the following functions:\nint GL.GenBufer();\nvoid GL.GenBuffers(int n, out int buffers);\nThese functions work the same way that generating textures works.

There are two values we care about:\n\nBufferTarget.ArrayBuffer is used when you want to specify vertex data such as position, normals, uv&#39;s etc...\nBufferTarget.ElementArrayBuffer is used if you are doing indexed rendering. This buffer will contain the indices for you to render.\n\nUnbind\nWhen you are done drawing with a buffer, you should unbind that buffer.

It&#39;s a large array, while you could fill it with interleaved data, i suggest filling it with consecutive data segments.\n\ninterleaved data is just data with a stride. That is the memory is laid out as: position, normal, uv, position, normal, uv, position, normal, uv....\nconsecutive data is laid out linearly. You have all your positions at the front of the array, then all your normals, then all your uvs, like so: position, position, position, normal, normal, normal, uv, uv, uv\n\nUsing consecutive data helps speed up the rendering process just a little bit, and makes it easyer to write the actual render code.\nThe last argument is a hint. Some OpenGL implementations will use this hint to optimize how they store the data, based on what you intend to do with it. There are two values to this that we care about:\n\nBufferUsageHint.StaticDraw is used for static objects.

If a buffer is bound, OpenGL assumes you are rendering VBO&#39;s, if not it assumes you are rendering vertex arrays. \nExample\nLet&#39;s take a look at some code that we used to render vertex arrays:\n    GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n    GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.ColorArray);\n\n    GL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, cubeVertices);\n    GL.ColorPointer(3, ColorPointerType.Float, 0, cubeColors);\n\n    GL.DrawElements(PrimitiveType.Triangles, cubeIndices.Length, DrawElementsType.UnsignedInt, cubeIndices);\n\n    GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n    GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.ColorArray);\n\nNow let&#39;s convert this to use VBO&#39;s. The first thing we need to do is to enable buffers before the call to GL.VertexPointer. I&#39;m also going to make sure to disable them once i&#39;m done rendering. Like so:\n    GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n    GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.ColorArray);\n\n    // NEW\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, vertexBuffer);\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ElementArrayBuffer, indexBuffer);\n\n    GL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, cubeVertices);\n    GL.ColorPointer(3, ColorPointerType.Float, 0, cubeColors);\n\n    GL.DrawElements(PrimitiveType.Triangles, cubeIndices.Length, DrawElementsType.UnsignedInt, cubeIndices);\n\n    // NEW\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, 0);\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ElementArrayBuffer, 0);\n\n    GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n    GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.ColorArray);\n\nNext up we need to change the GL.VertexPointer and GL.ColorPointer functions. The only thing that changes is the last argument. Instead of being an array, it now becomes an int pointer, but it does not point to anything! \nInstead of using an int-pointer we just pack an integer into the pointer If this sounds stupid, that&#39;s because it is, it&#39;s a leftover thing from OpenGL being a C-API. So this last paramater now signifies the offset from the begenning of the buffer that our data is located at.\n    GL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, new System.IntPtr(0));\n    GL.ColorPointer(3, ColorPointerType.Float, 0, new System.IntPtr(sizeof(float) * 8 * 3));\n\nIn my buffer the first 8 * 3 floats are the position of my cube. So, the cube vertices are at offset 0. But then the colors come after, so those are \n8 * 3 * sizeof(float)  bytes away from the front of the buffer.\nNow, if we didn&#39;t have an index buffer bound, this would already render. Just because you have a vertex buffer doesn&#39;t mean you have to use an index buffer. But more often than not you will. This means that we must also change the GL.DrawElements function. \nThe GL.DrawElements fucntion changes the same way the others did. The last argument becomes an int-pointer. It&#39;s value is an integer, not a real pointer. This integer specifies how many bytes from the begenning of the buffer the data we are rendering is located. The new call becomes:\nGL.DrawElements(PrimitiveType.Triangles, numIndices, DrawElementsType.UnsignedInt, System.IntPtr.Zero);\nPutting it all together\nLet&#39;s take a look at the new render function in full context\npublic override void Render() {\n    Matrix4 lookAt = Matrix4.LookAt(new Vector3(-7.0f, 5.0f, -7.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));\n    GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(lookAt).Matrix);\n\n    GL.Disable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n    grid.Render();\n    GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n\n    GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n    GL.EnableClientState(ArrayCap.ColorArray);\n\n    // Bind vertex and index buffer, OpenGL will use VBO&#39;s from here on out\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, vertexBuffer);\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ElementArrayBuffer, indexBuffer);\n\n    // 0 bytes from the begenning of the buffer\n    GL.VertexPointer(3, VertexPointerType.Float, 0, new System.IntPtr(0));\n    // The buffer first contains positions, which are 8 vertices, made up of 3 floats each.\n    // after that comes the color information, therefore the colors are:\n    // 8 * 3 * sizeof(float) bytes away from the begenning of the buffer\n    GL.ColorPointer(3, ColorPointerType.Float, 0, new System.IntPtr(sizeof(float) * 8 * 3));\n\n    // The index buffer only contains indices we want to draw, so they are 0 bytes\n    // from the begenning of the array. You can use the constant i use here instead\n    // of making a new IntPtr, if the offset you are looking for is 0\n    GL.DrawElements(PrimitiveType.Triangles, numIndices, DrawElementsType.UnsignedInt, System.IntPtr.Zero);\n\n    // Unbind vertex and index buffers, OpenGL will draw VA&#39;s from here on out\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, 0);\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ElementArrayBuffer, 0);\n\n    GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.VertexArray);\n    GL.DisableClientState(ArrayCap.ColorArray);\n}\n\n"},"Chapter8/vb4.html":{"url":"Chapter8/vb4.html","title":"Cleanup","body":"Cleanup\nCleaning up vertex buffers is pretty easy, the function call is:\nvoid GL.DeleteBuffer(int bufferId);\nThis call signals to OpenGL that it&#39;s ok to delete the data in the buffer.

We&#39;re going to build a mesh class that can load these OBJ models and render them using vertex buffer objects.\nThe Format\nAn OBJ file is just a text file. It&#39;s a standard format that supports a LARGE standard with many features. We&#39;re only going to implement loading a small specific subset of obj files.\nEvery OBJ we load we&#39;re going to assume has a set vertex format containing a position, a texture coordinate and a normal. Not all OBJ files have all of this information, but the subset we load we assume will.\nLet&#39;s take a look at what the inside of an OBJ file looks like:\n# Blender3D v249 OBJ File: untitled.blend\n# www.blender3d.org\nmtllib cube.mtl\nv 1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000\nv 1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000\nv -1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000\nv -1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000\nv 1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000\nv 0.999999 1.000000 1.000001\nv -1.000000 1.000000 1.000000\nv -1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000\nvt 0.748573 0.750412\nvt 0.749279 0.501284\nvt 0.999110 0.501077\nvt 0.999455 0.750380\nvt 0.250471 0.500702\nvt 0.249682 0.749677\nvt 0.001085 0.750380\nvt 0.001517 0.499994\nvt 0.499422 0.500239\nvt 0.500149 0.750166\nvt 0.748355 0.998230\nvt 0.500193 0.998728\nvt 0.498993 0.250415\nvt 0.748953 0.250920\nvn 0.000000 0.000000 -1.000000\nvn -1.000000 -0.000000 -0.000000\nvn -0.000000 -0.000000 1.000000\nvn -0.000001 0.000000 1.000000\nvn 1.000000 -0.000000 0.000000\nvn 1.000000 0.000000 0.000001\nvn 0.000000 1.000000 -0.000000\nvn -0.000000 -1.000000 0.000000\nusemtl Material_ray.png\ns off\nf 5/1/1 1/2/1 4/3/1\nf 5/1/1 4/3/1 8/4/1\nf 3/5/2 7/6/2 8/7/2\nf 3/5/2 8/7/2 4/8/2\nf 2/9/3 6/10/3 3/5/3\nf 6/10/4 7/6/4 3/5/4\nf 1/2/5 5/1/5 2/9/5\nf 5/1/6 6/10/6 2/9/6\nf 5/1/7 8/11/7 6/10/7\nf 8/11/7 7/12/7 6/10/7\nf 1/2/8 2/9/8 3/13/8\nf 1/2/8 3/13/8 4/14/8\nEvery line begins with some kind of a letter or phrase to describe the information the line will hold. Then, the information appears in a specific format. There are more line markers than what is listed above / what we will be using. This means its important for your parser to ignore unknown line starts.\nHere are the lines we will care about:\n\nv is a vertex\nvt is the texture coordinate of one vertex\nvn is the normal of one vertex\nf is a face (triangle)\n\nAnd these are the things we don&#39;t care about:\n\nAny line that begins with # is a comment, just like // in C#\nusemtl and mtllib describe the look of the model. We won’t use this in this tutorial.\ns stands for specular, it can be off or it can be some number\n\nA material describes how to shade a model. OBJ files often come with .mtl files which then link to textures. We&#39;re not going to care about mtl files. We just want to get vertex data into our game!\nData format\nNow that we know that we only care about v, vt, vn and f, let&#39;s take a look at the format of each of these lines:\nv, vt and vn are simple to understand. The letter is followed by a space, then three space seperated floats. That&#39;s the line.\nf is more tricky. So, for f 8/11/7 7/12/7 6/10/7 :\n\n8/11/7 describes the first vertex of the triangle\n7/12/7 describes the second vertex of the triangle\n6/10/7 describes the third vertex of the triangle \nFor the first vertex, 8 says which vertex to use. So in this case, -1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000 (index start to 1, not to 0 like in C#)\n11 says which texture coordinate to use. So in this case, 0.748355 0.998230\n7 says which normal to use. So in this case, 0.000000 1.000000 -0.000000\n\nA triangle is described as 3 sets of indices into the vertex / uv / normal arrays. It&#39;s important to note that arrays in C# are indexed starting at 0, in OBJ land they start at 1. A conversion needs to be made when you write your parser.\n"},"Chapter8/lmesh.html":{"url":"Chapter8/lmesh.html","title":"Implementation","body":"Implementation\nIt may not be immediateley obvious, but because an OBJ file has 3 indices per vertex attribute (Look at the f paramater in the last section) it does not suit its-self well for indexed rendering. This is because a vertex position and normal might not appear at the same index.\nBecause of this we will need to serialize the data, meaning make it linear. So first we&#39;re going to load the data into temp arrays, then loop trough the arrays and flatten them out. Then we can render un-indexed using GL.DrawArrays.\nSkeleton\nI&#39;m going to get you started with a class skeleton for the OBJ loader:\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class OBJModel {\n        protected int vertexBuffer = -1;\n\n        protected bool hasNormals = false;\n        protected bool hasUvs = false;\n\n        protected int numVerts = 0;\n        protected int numNormals = 0;\n        protected int numUvs = 0;\n\n        public OBJModel(string path) {\n            // TODO: Load\n        }\n\n        public void Destroy() {\n            // TODO: Destroy\n        }\n\n        public void Render(bool useNormals = true, bool useTextures = true) {\n            if (vertexBuffer == -1) {\n                return;\n            }\n\n            if (!hasNormals) {\n                useNormals = false;\n            }\n\n            if (!hasUvs) {\n                useTextures = false;\n            }\n\n            // TODO: Render\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe member variables are all protected becasue they are only used for rendering.\nLoading\nLoading can be broken up into two parts, first reading all of the data in, then parsing all of the data. I&#39;m going to provide some skeleton code for you to work in for this one.\nFirst let&#39;s make 6 arrays. One to hold sequential vertex information, one for normals and one for texCoords. When you encounter a line like\nv 0 10.0 20.0\nThat should add 3 floats to the vertices array, 0, 10 and 20. Same for normals and tex-coords. \nThen we have three more arrays, all unsigned integers. These are for the actual triangle data. For example, if a triangle is listed as such\nf 1//2 4//5 6//8\nThat should put 1, 4 and 6 into the vertex index array, 2, 5 and 8 into the normal index array and nothing into the uv index array. Do take note, ANY of those numbers could be missing, be in the double digits, etc...\npublic OBJModel(string path) {\n    List&lt;float&gt; vertices = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n    List&lt;float&gt; normals = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n    List&lt;float&gt; texCoords = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n\n    List&lt;uint&gt; vertIndex = new List&lt;uint&gt;();\n    List&lt;uint&gt; normIndex = new List&lt;uint&gt;();\n    List&lt;uint&gt; uvIndex = new List&lt;uint&gt;();\n\n    using (TextReader tr = File.OpenText(path)) {\n        string line = tr.ReadLine();\n        while (line != null) {\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(line) || line.Length &lt; 2) {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // TODO Parse Line, fill out above arrays\n\n            line = tr.ReadLine();\n        }\n    }\n\nOnce all the data is parsed, it&#39;s time to process it into something that&#39;s a bit more sequential. For this i&#39;m going to make 3 new arrays that contain positions, normals and uv&#39;s all in order.\n    List&lt;float&gt; vertexData = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n    List&lt;float&gt; normalData = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n    List&lt;float&gt; uvData = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n\n  Then, we&#39;re going to loop trough the index arrays we&#39;ve build up and fill the sequential data up in order. One of the things you will notice is index * 3 + 1, why is this needed all over the place? \n  Because indexin assumes that we have an array of float3&#39;s, that is, each array element is 3 floats. C# would support this with a multidimensional array, but we can modify the indexing of our big array to emulate that effect. \n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; vertIndex.Count; ++i) {\n        vertexData.Add(vertices[(int)vertIndex[i] * 3 + 0]);\n        vertexData.Add(vertices[(int)vertIndex[i] * 3 + 1]);\n        vertexData.Add(vertices[(int)vertIndex[i] * 3 + 2]);\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; normIndex.Count; ++i) {\n        normalData.Add(normals[(int)normIndex[i] * 3 + 0]);\n        normalData.Add(normals[(int)normIndex[i] * 3 + 1]);\n        normalData.Add(normals[(int)normIndex[i] * 3 + 2]);\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; uvIndex.Count; ++i) {\n        uvData.Add(texCoords[(int)uvIndex[i] * 2 + 0]);\n        uvData.Add(texCoords[(int)uvIndex[i] * 2 + 1]);\n    }\n\nWe now have enough data to fill in the class member variables:\n    hasNormals = normalData.Count &gt; 0;\n    hasUvs = uvData.Count &gt; 0;\n\n    numVerts = vertexData.Count;\n    numUvs = uvData.Count;\n    numNormals = normalData.Count;\n\nFinally it&#39;s time to upload all this data to the GPU, i&#39;m going to make one last array, this is going to be used to transfer ALL of the above properties to OpenGL. Then we&#39;re just going to make a buffer and populate it with data from this new array.\n    List&lt;float&gt; data = new List&lt;float&gt;();\n    data.AddRange(vertexData);\n    data.AddRange(normalData);\n    data.AddRange(uvData);\n\n    vertexBuffer = GL.GenBuffer();\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, vertexBuffer);\n    GL.BufferData(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, new IntPtr(data.Count * sizeof(float)), data.ToArray(), BufferUsageHint.StaticDraw);\n    GL.BindBuffer(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, 0);\n}\nUnloading\nThe destroy function is pretty simple:\n\nMake sure no buffers are bound (unbind buffer)\nActually delete the buffer\nSet buffer handle to -1\n\nRendering\nRendering is pretty simple too, i want you to try it on your own\nFirst, enable the appropriate client states. Take note of the arguments the function takes, if for example use normals is false, then don&#39;t enable the normals array.\nNext, bind your aray buffer\nThen set your client pointers, the vertex pointer will always start at ofset 0, the normal pointer is at numverts * sizeof(float), and the uv pointer is at (numverts + numnorms) * sizeof(float).

You obviously don&#39;t want to load the same texture 20 times. So do you keep a counter around? How do you manage the lifecycle of those textures? This is where resource management comes in handy.\nReference counting\nThe basic idea behind resource management is simple, it&#39;s called reference counting. You put all of the code related to loading a specific type of asset into a class. Let&#39;s assume we&#39;re working with meshes. We could easily make a MeshManager class. This class would contain all the code needed to load meshes. \nThe manager needs to keep a counter for every mesh. This is the reference counter. It increments every time a mesh is loaded and decrements every time a mesh is unloaded. Once this reference counter reaches 0 the mesh in question is deleted, because it&#39;s no longer being used.\nHandles\nWhen a manager loads an asset, it owns the resource. You are essentially leasing an instance of that resource, eventually you have to give it back. In the case of a mesh you will need a way to access the array of verts, in the case of a texture you will need the OpenGL texture ID. So, how do you get a reference to this?\nThe answer here is a handle. Once a manager loads a resource it needs to give you a resource handle. When it gives you the resource handle, the reference count is increased. When you give the resource handle back, it is decreased. So what is a resource handle?\nIt can be anything! Well, anything that will uniquelly identify an object. The most common things to use as resource handles are integers and strings. For example, the 2DOpenTKFramework we used returned integer handles.\nPrevious framework\nSpeaking of the 2D framework we used, let&#39;s take a quick look at how it functioned. Take some time and browse trough the TextureManager class. Knowing the above information should help you navigate the class.\nIn the TextureManager i have an internal class that represents each texture instance, this calss is called TextureInstance. The TextureManager contains a List of TextureInstances. \nWhen a new texture is requested i loop trough this list, and check the path of each intance. If a path identical to the texture being requested is found, it&#39;s reference count is incremented and a handle is returned.\nIf the texture was not found in the list, i loop trough the list, looking for any texture instances with a reference count of 0. \nThis manager utilizes lazy unloading, meaning when the reference count reaches 0 the texture is not unloaded. Instead textures are unloaded if a new texture is requested and a slot with a 0 reference is available.\nIf there was no 0 reference slot available and the texture was not already loaded, a new one is made and added to the list. And a handle to that is returned.\nSo what are the handles in the framework? The handle of a texture is it&#39;s index in the list. Why did i choose that, it is the cheapest way to retrieve a texture. Loading a texture is expensive, but retreaving it is relativley cheap.\nWhats next?\nNext up, i want to walk you trough actually creating a simple resource manager. \nThere is no one size fits all solution for asset management, and the methods i show you are far from perfect. Each game figures out what they need and build the asset pipeline around their needs. Engines like Unity or Unreal handle this for you.\nI like to create a spearate manager for each asset type. That is, i&#39;ll have a TextureManager a MeshManager, an AudioManager and so on. Some companies just make a single class called AssetManager that manages every possible asset type. Like i said before, there is no wrong or right way. What you use depends on what makes sense to you and what your game needs.\n"},"Chapter8/resource_impl.html":{"url":"Chapter8/resource_impl.html","title":"Design","body":"Designing a Manager\nLet&#39;s go trough and create a texture manager together. What functions will this manager need?\n\nInitialize All managers should have some kind of initialize function (that&#39;s not the constructor). Even if the function does nothing, it helps keep code readable\nDestroy Whatever is initialized must be destroyed! This is also a good place to warn the rest of the code if any resources where not unloaded\nLoadTexture This function is the powerhouse, it does the actual work of loading a texture, OR incrementing the reference on an already loaded texture\nUnloadTexture LoadTexture requests memory, this function will release memory\nGetSize We need a way to retrieve the width / height of a texture, we might need it to normalize coordinates.\nGetTexture We need a way to access the raw OpenGL texture handle. This is it.\n\nAre there any other considerations to designing this system? Tons! Do we want insertion of new data to be fast and retrieval to be slow? Or do we want insertion to be slow and retrieval to be fast? \nThis is an important question because it affects the data structures we will use internally. If we want to retrieve the data fast, we must store it in a linear array, but every time we insert that array must be searched; making retrieval slow.\nBecause most games use a loading screen when loading assets, we&#39;re going to design this system for fast retrieval, slow insertion. This means the underlying data structure is going to be an array, so our handles will be integers (Indices into the array)\nHelper classes\nWe can&#39;t just have an array of OpenGL handles. We need more data! Like a unique way of identifying each texture (the texture path) and a reference count (an integer). \nWe could maintain parallel arrays, but it would become a nightmare to maintain them all. Instead we&#39;re going to use OOP design, and make private inner classes to the manager. \nA private inner class means that the class will not be referenced (or known) from outside of the manager, and that&#39;s a good thing, it&#39;s just housekeeping data.\n"},"Chapter8/resource_real_design.html":{"url":"Chapter8/resource_real_design.html","title":"Implementation","body":"Implementation\nLet&#39;s start laying out the skeleton of the main class and implementing the helper class.

Then we just make a new TextureInstance list and set the  isInitialized variable to true.\nWhy is this in the code managedTextures.Capacity = 100;? By setting the initial capacity to 100 we ensure that the List (Vector) has enough room for at least 100 elements.

To make sure that no texture is loaded twice. \nThis function returns an integer, it is a handle, it&#39;s an index into the managedTextures array. There are three possible situations this function needs to handle:\nFirst, if the texture path requested is already loaded, increment it&#39;s reference count and return it&#39;s handle. If the texture is not already loaded, a new texture must be allocated, the next two steps deal with this allocation.\nNext, it loops trough all the loaded textures in the array. If any of them have a reference count of &lt; 0, that means that texture is already unloaded. We take this unloaded texture, and load the new texture into it&#39;s slot, essentially recycling the texture handle.\nFinally, if the texture was not already loaded and we cant recycle any texture handles; we will load the texture and add it to the array, creating a new texture handle.\npublic int LoadTexture(string texturePath, bool UseNearestFiltering = false) {\n    InitCheck(&quot;Trying to load texture without intializing texture manager!&quot;);\n\n    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(texturePath)) {\n        Error(&quot;Load texture file path was null&quot;);\n        throw new ArgumentException(texturePath);\n    }\n\n    // Check if the texture is already loaded.

It decreases the reference count of the provided texture handle by 1. If the reference count of a texture reaches 0, that texture is deleted, it&#39;s handle will become eligable to be recycled.\npublic void UnloadTexture(int textureId) {\n    InitCheck(&quot;Trying to unload texture without intializing texture manager!&quot;);\n    IndexCheck(textureId, &quot;UnloadTexture&quot;);\n\n    managedTextures[textureId].refCount -= 1;\n    if (managedTextures[textureId].refCount == 0) {\n        GL.DeleteTexture(managedTextures[i].glHandle);\n    }\n    else if (managedTextures[textureId].refCount &lt; 0) {\n        Error(&quot;Ref count of texture is less than 0: &quot; + managedTextures[textureId].path);\n    }\n}\n\nGetTextureWidth\nThis function is a simple getter that returns the width of a texture. This is information that LoadTexture stored inside the actual managedTextures element when the texture was loaded.\npublic int GetTextureWidth(int textureId) {\n    InitCheck(&quot;Trying to access texture width without intializing texture manager!&quot;);\n    IndexCheck(textureId, &quot;GetTextureWidth&quot;);\n\n    return managedTextures[textureId].width;\n}\n\nGetTextureHeight\nThis function is a simple getter that returns the height of a texture.

It&#39;s ok to look at lighting, but it&#39;s not great. In this chapter we&#39;re going to go ahead and create a FPS camera.\nThere are plenty of tutorials out there on this topic, my favorite one is this, it&#39;s written for C++ OpenGL. But there are a lot of OpenTK specific ones too, like this one or this one.\nInstead of following those tutorials (which can be overcomplicated at times) we&#39;re just going to set up our own. Making a camera is simple, you need to first figure out the world position of the camera. For this you need to figure out it&#39;s rotation and orientation. You then take the world position and invert it to get a view matrix.\nHow you figure out the world position of a camera is the difference between the FPS, RTS, 3rd person, etc... camera models. For an FPS camera, the rotation on the Y and X axis updates based on mouse movement, while the position updates based on the WASD keys.\nFramework\nI&#39;m going to provide the code for the framework we&#39;re going to be working in. It&#39;s more or less a copy / paste of the OBJ test scene. Take note of the Using directives, we want to use OpenTK.Input for mouse / keyboard and Math_Implementation for Matrix and Vector classes\nusing System;\nusing OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL;\nusing Math_Implementation;\nusing OpenTK.Input;\n\nnamespace GameApplication {\n    class CameraExample : Game {\n        Grid grid = null;\n        OBJModel model = null;\n\n        // TODO: Set based on camera input\n        protected Matrix4 viewMatrix = new Matrix4();\n\n        public override void Resize(int width, int height) {\n            GL.Viewport(0, 0, width, height);\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Projection);\n            float aspect = (float)width / (float)height;\n            Matrix4 perspective = Matrix4.Perspective(60.0f, aspect, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\n            GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(perspective).Matrix);\n            GL.MatrixMode(MatrixMode.Modelview);\n            GL.LoadIdentity();\n        }\n\n        public override void Initialize() {\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.CullFace);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.Light0);\n\n            Resize(MainGameWindow.Window.Width, MainGameWindow.Window.Height);\n\n            grid = new Grid(true);\n            model = new OBJModel(&quot;Assets/test_object.obj&quot;);\n\n            GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Position, new float[] { 0.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f });\n            GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Ambient, new float[] { 0f, 1f, 0f, 1f });\n            GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Diffuse, new float[] { 0f, 1f, 0f, 1f });\n            GL.Light(LightName.Light0, LightParameter.Specular, new float[] { 1f, 1f, 1f, 1f });\n        }\n\n        public override void Shutdown() {\n            model.Destroy();\n        }\n\n        public override void Update(float dTime) {\n            // TODO: Move 3D camera\n        }\n\n        public override void Render() {\n             GL.LoadMatrix(Matrix4.Transpose(viewMatrix).Matrix);\n\n            GL.Disable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n            GL.Disable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            grid.Render();\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);\n            GL.Enable(EnableCap.Lighting);\n\n            GL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);\n            model.Render(true, false);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe new thing to note here is the viewMatrix matrix. We use it to set the view when rendering. Right now it&#39;s set to identity, so you should see almost nothing when rendering. We&#39;re going to be updating this based on the move code.\nVariables\nLet&#39;s start by adding some class variables.\nprotected float Yaw = 0f;\nprotected float Pitch = 0f\nprotected Vector3 CameraPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 10);\nprotected Vector2 LastMousePosition = new Vector2();\n/*Already exists*/ protected Matrix4 viewMatrix;\n\nYaw and Pitch are the Y and X rotation of the camera respectivley. This represents the cameras orientation in the world.\nWhen we&#39;re talking about orientation, we use the terms yaw, pitch and roll. You multiply these together to get an orientation. Order matters!\norientation = roll * pitch * yaw;\n\nNext we&#39;ve added a Vector3 to represent the cameras position in the world. We&#39;re going to start the camera off at 10 units in the Z axis. If we started it at 0 it would start INSIDE the 3D model, instead we want to be looking at it.\nLast we need to add a Vector2 to maintain the last position of the mouse. We need this because we have to calculate the delta movement of the mouse. Depending on the input library you are using this might not be needed, some input handlers will have a GetMouseDelta function. OpenTK by default does not.\nAnd of course the viewMatrix variable was already there in the skeleton framework.\nThe Camera\nWe&#39;re going to implement our FPS camera in a helper function. I&#39;ve documented this function using comments, be sure to read them!\n// Returns the view matrix. Takes in delta time and a movement speed.\nMatrix4 Move3DCamera(float timeStep, float moveSpeed = 10f) {\n    // Helper variables, we need to know the mouse and keyboard states\n    const float mouseSensitivity = .01f;\n    MouseState mouse = OpenTK.Input.Mouse.GetState();\n    KeyboardState keyboard = OpenTK.Input.Keyboard.GetState();\n\n    // Figure out the delta mouse movement\n    Vector2 mousePosition = new Vector2(mouse.X, mouse.Y);\n    var mouseMove = mousePosition - LastMousePosition;\n    LastMousePosition = mousePosition;\n\n    // If the left button is pressed, update Yaw and Pitch based on delta mouse\n    if (mouse.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed) {\n        Yaw -= mouseSensitivity * mouseMove.X;\n        Pitch -= mouseSensitivity * mouseMove.Y;\n        if (Pitch &lt; -90f) {\n            Pitch = 90f;\n        }\n        else if (Pitch &gt; 90f) {\n            Pitch = 90f;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Now that we have yaw and pitch, create an orientation matrix\n    Matrix4 pitch = Matrix4.XRotation(Pitch);\n    Matrix4 yaw = Matrix4.YRotation(Yaw);\n    Matrix4 orientation = /*roll * */ pitch * yaw;\n\n    // Get the orientations right and forward vectors\n    Vector3 right = Matrix4.MultiplyVector(orientation, new Vector3(1f, 0f, 0f));\n    Vector3 forward = Matrix4.MultiplyVector(orientation, new Vector3(0f, 0f, 1f));\n\n    // Update movement based on WASD\n    if (keyboard[OpenTK.Input.Key.W]) {\n        CameraPosition += forward * -1f * moveSpeed * timeStep;\n    }\n    if (keyboard[OpenTK.Input.Key.S]) {\n        CameraPosition += forward * moveSpeed * timeStep;\n    }\n    if (keyboard[OpenTK.Input.Key.A]) {\n        CameraPosition += right * -1f * moveSpeed * timeStep;\n    }\n    if (keyboard[OpenTK.Input.Key.D]) {\n        CameraPosition += right * moveSpeed * timeStep;\n    }\n\n    // Now that we have a position vector, make a position matrix\n    Matrix4 position = Matrix4.Translate(CameraPosition);\n    // Using position and orientation, get the camera in world space\n    Matrix4 cameraWorldPosition = position * orientation;\n    // The view matrix is the inverse of the cameras world space matrix\n    Matrix4 cameraViewMatrix = Matrix4.Inverse(cameraWorldPosition);\n\n    return cameraViewMatrix;\n}\n\nThe function is verbose, but it&#39;s pretty simple. Following the steps outlined below you can construct just about any kind of camera.\nUpdate pitch and yaw by the mouse delta position. Because Pitch looks up and down, clamp it to the -90 to 90 range. Once we have these, construct a new orientation.\nUpdate the position vector based on the WASD key states and orientation. Once we have an updated position, make a position matrix.\nWe can&#39;t just move the camera based on world forward and up, we want to take the orientation of the camera into account when moving. That&#39;s why we take the right vector (1, 0, 0) and multiply it by the orientation matrix, to get the local right vector of that matrix. Same with forward.\nOnce we have a position and orientation matrix we can figure out where the camera is in world space.\nOnce you know where the camera is in world space, the view matrix is just the inverse of that.\nApplying the camera\nNow that we have the code to move our camera in 3D, we still need to call it.\npublic override void Update(float dTime) {\n    viewMatrix = Move3DCamera(dTime);\n}\n\nWith that, go ahead and run the application. You should be able to move with WASD, and when you click your mouse button, dragging it should look around the screen.\nYou can adjust the mouse sensitivity using the mouseSensitivity constant in the move function. If the WASD movement is too slow, you can adjust it using the functions second argument.\n"},"Chapter8/halfspace.html":{"url":"Chapter8/halfspace.html","title":"Halfspace Culling","body":"Half Space Culling\nSo far we&#39;ve rendered everything, no matter what. And that&#39;s ok, for small demos. But even the simplest game could not get away from that. Think of a modern game, like Assasins Creed. They have MILLIONS of objects per scene. Rendering them all would make the game unplayable.\nSo what&#39;s the solution? Don&#39;t render what you can&#39;t see! This is called view culling. We cull out all invisible objects, and NEVER actually render them. Over the years view culling has gotten increasingly more complex, but we&#39;re going to start off with the simplest implementation, half space culling.\nThe theory behind half space culling is simple. Construct a plane at the position of the camera, the plane will span the cameras X and Y axis, and will face in the direction of it&#39;s Z axis. Then, test all models we are rendering against this plane. Only render models that are in front of the plane. This way, we don&#39;t render anything behind the camera!\nHow do we actually test what side of the plane a point is on? Using the game programmers bread and butter, the dot product! If you want to google how to do this, you should be looking for Half Space Test.\nPlane\nA plane in 3D space can be thought of as a flat surface extending indefinitely in all directions. It can be described in several different ways. For examply by:\n\nThree points not on a straight line\nA normal, and a point on the plane\nA normal, and a distance from origin\n\nLet&#39;s define a plane class in code:\nclass Plane {\n  public Vector3 n; // Plane normal. Points x on the plane satisfy Dot(n, x) = d\n  public float d; // Distance from origin, d = Dot(n, p), for a given point p on the plane\n}\n\nSo we&#39;ve chosen to represent a plane as a normal and a distance from origin. We can calulate this plane, from 3 (3D) points\nstatic Plane ComputePlane(Vector3 a, Vector3 b, Vector3 c) {\n  Plane p = new Plane();\n  p.n = Vector3.Normalize(Vector3.Cross(b - a, c - a));\n  p.d = Dot(p.n, a);\n  return p;\n}\n\nWhen two planes are not parallel to each other, they intersect in a line. Similarly, three planes (two not parallel to each other) intersect at a 3D point.\nTheory\nThe theory of a half space test is simple. Given a plane, with a normal. What is the angle between the plane and the point!\nRemember how the dot product works! If we take the planes up vector, and a vector from the plane to the point we are testing we can do a dot product between the two vectors. \nThe result of this dot product is the half space test, remember if the result of the dot product is:\n\n0, the vectors are perpendicular (90 degrees)\npositive, the vectors are less than 90 degrees apart\nnegative, the vectors are more than 90 degrees apart\n\nSo, if the dot product of the planes vector and the vector from the plane to the point is:\n\n0, the point is on the plane\npositive, the point is in front of the plane\nnegative, the point is behind the plane\n\nHalf Space Test\nBefore we talk about the half space test, let&#39;s take a quick look at the plane equasion (Equasion of a plane).\na * x + b * y + c * z + d = 0\nWhere, ABC is the normal of the plane, D is the distance of the plane from origin and XYZ is some point. This equasion states that if point XYZ is on the plane, the result of the above equasion is 0. If a point is in front of the plane the result will be a positive number (distance from the plane) and if the point is behind the plane the result will be a negative number.\nBecause you already know what ABC and D are, you could just plug int XYZ into the above equasion and return the result. Try implementing this function in code\nstatic float HalfSpace(Plane p, Vector3 v) {\n  // TODO: Return result of plane equasion\n}\n\nThe above code is the preffered method of implementing the half space test. A solution is given at the end of the page\nAlternate representation\nThere are other ways of representing planes, and doing the half space test. For example, a plane can be represented by a normal and any point on the plane. As opposed to what we have now, a normal and a distance from origin. \nIf this was the case, the half space test would in involve subtracting the plane point from the point you are testing to get a direction vector, then doing a dot product with the plane normal and direction vector.\nBecause the dot product returns a number that is relative to an angle this representation might be easyer to understand. \n\nIf the dot of the plane normal and direction vector is negative, then the angle is greater than 90 degrees\nif it is 0 then the angle is exactly 90 degrees (on the plane)\nIf it is positive, then the angle is less than 90 degrees\n\n\nWe can actually make a point on the plane by multiplying the plane normal by the plane distance. Once we have a point on the plane we could use the dot product to perform a half space test.\npublic static float HalfSpace(Plane p,Vector3 v) {\n    Vector4 N = new Vector4(p.n.X, p.n.Y, p.n.Z, 0f);\n    Vector4 PointOnPlane = new Vector4(p.n.X * p.d, p.n.Y * p.d, p.n.Z * p.d, 1);\n    Vector4 V = PointOnPlane - new Vector4(v.X, v.Y, v.Z, 1f);\n    return Vector4.Dot(N, V);\n}\n\nImplementation\nCool, now that we understand the half space test (If you don&#39;t call me on skype) let&#39;s go ahead and implement it in our test scene.\nImplement a Plane class, and the HalfSpace function. For ease of use, make the HalfSpace function a static member of the Plane class. Also, make the ComputePlane function a static member of the plane class.\nInside the example application, after all the camera variables, add a new Plane variable:\n... old code\nprotected Vector3 CameraPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 10);\nprotected Vector2 LastMousePosition = new Vector2();\nprotected Matrix4 viewMatrix;\n// NEW\nPlane cameraPlane = null;\n\nWe&#39;re going to construct this new plane inside the Move3DCamera function. We know we can construct a plane using 3 points, so what 3 points of the camera can we use to make a plane?\nWell we know the forward and right and up of the camera. We can use the right and up to construct a camera plane whose normal will be the camera forward. But that&#39;s only two vectors, what about the third one? We can invert the right vector to get a left vector. \nThis means we can create the camera plane using the camera world matrix left, right and up planes. Let&#39;s see how this would look in code:\n...old code\nMatrix4 position = Matrix4.Translate(CameraPosition);\nMatrix4 cameraWorldPosition = orientation * position;\nMatrix4 cameraViewMatrix = Matrix4.Inverse(cameraWorldPosition);\n\n// NEW\nright = new Vector3(cameraWorldPosition[0, 0], cameraWorldPosition[1, 0], cameraWorldPosition[2, 0]);\nVector3 left = new Vector3(-right.X, -right.Y, -right.Z);\nVector3 up = new Vector3(cameraWorldPosition[0, 1], cameraWorldPosition[1, 1], cameraWorldPosition[2, 1]);\n\nright = Matrix4.MultiplyPoint(cameraWorldPosition, right);\nleft = Matrix4.MultiplyPoint(cameraWorldPosition, left);\nup = Matrix4.MultiplyPoint(cameraWorldPosition, up);\n\ncameraPlane = Plane.ComputePlane(left, right, up);\n\n// OLD\nreturn cameraViewMatrix;\n... old code\n\nWe get the right, and up out of the matrix, then invert right to get left. Remember, you can extract a matrices  forward, right and up basis vectors because they make up the upper 3x3 matrix:\n\nWe could have multiplied the right and up vectors by the orientation matrix, like earlyer in this same function, but extracting the vectors straight from the matrix is much simpler (and a lot less expensive). And you should be aware of both ways to extract the vector.\nHowever, extracting these vectors is not enough. These are vectors, not points, so the translation has not been applied yet. That&#39;s why we multiply each of these vectors by the world matrix of the camera.\nAfter we have left, right and up in world space (each one unit away from the cameras position), we can construct the camera plane.\nFinally, lets modify the render code:\nif (Plane.HalfSpace(cameraPlane, new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f)) &gt;= 0) {\n    GL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);\n    model.Render(true, false);\n}\nelse {\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Green susane culled&quot;);\n}\n\nNow if you move past susane, or rotate the camera that she&#39;s off screen, we wont see her. But some text will be written to the console instead.\nWhy are we testing 0, 0, 0 for susane, because she is rendered at origin. If you have a model rendered at 2, 4, 6 you would test that point.\nSolution\nAbove i mentioned a solution would be given at the end of the page:\nstatic float HalfSpace(Plane p, Vector3 v) {\n  return (p.n.X*v.X) + (p.n.Y*v.Y) + (p.n.Z*v.Z) + p.d;\n}\n\n"},"Chapter8/frustum.html":{"url":"Chapter8/frustum.html","title":"Frustum Culling","body":"Frustum Culling\nHalfspace culling was a good start, but it&#39;s far from optimal. For one, you don&#39;t have a 180 degree field of view, the camera can usually only see about 60 degrees wide. Also, it does not take any of the other planes into account. Things might be out of view to the left, right, top, bottom, they may be too far or behind the camera.\nThis is where Frustum Culling comes in. We don&#39;t use frustum culling in conjunction with halfspace culling, INSTEAD OF halfspace culling we do frustum culling. \nThis method revolves around the cameras frusutm:\n\nBasically if an object is not inside the green frustum it will not be rendered. The math behind frustum culling isn&#39;t much different than the math behind Half Space Culling. It&#39;s the same thing actually!\nTo do Furstum culling, we first extract the 6 planes that make up the Frustum from the modelview matrix. Then, we do a half space test with ALL 6 planes. If the point is in front of all 6 planes then we render the object. If any one fails, we reject the object from being rendered.\nExtracting planes\nRecall the plane equation\na * x + b * y + c * z + d = 0\nTo extract the planes of a frustum, you need the viewProjection matrix, which you get by multiplying the projection and view matrices together. The plane values can be found by adding or subtracting one of the first three rows of the viewProjection matrix from the fourth row.\n\nLeft Plane Row 1 (addition)\nRight Plane Row 1 Negated (subtraction)\nBottom Plane Row 2 (addition)\nTop Plane Row 2 Negated (subtraction)\nNear Plane Row 3 (addition)\nFar Plane Row 3 Negated (subtraction)\n\nSo, assuming that matrix mp is the view-projection matrix, you could get the left and right planes like so:\nMatrix4 mv =  perspective * view;\n\nVector4 row1 = new Vector4(mv[0, 0], mv[0, 1], mv[0, 2], mv[0, 3]);\nVector4 row4 = new Vector4(mv[3, 0], mv[3, 1], mv[3, 2], mv[3, 3]);\n\nVector4 p1 = row4 + row1;\nVector4 p2 = row4 - row1;\n\nPlane left = new Plane();\nleft.n = new Vector3();\nleft.n.X = p1.X;\nleft.n.Y = p1.Y;\nleft.n.Z = p1.Z;\nleft.d = p1.w;\n\nPlane right = new Plane();\nright.n = new Vector3();\nright.n.X = p2.X;\nright.n.Y = p2.Y;\nright.n.Z = p2.Z;\nright.d = p2.w;\n\nFrustum Culling\nOnce you have all the planes of a matrix, the actual Frustum Culling comes down to doing 6 half space tests. Assume that we have our frustum defined like so:\nPlane[] frustum = new Plane[6];\n\nvoid Init() {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i) {\n    frustum[i] = new Plane();\n  }\n\n  ExtractPlanes(); // Fill the global frustum variable with planes\n}\n\nNow that we have a frustum, the culling code becomes very simple, first we use a helper function to test if a point is inside a frustum:\npublic bool PointInFrustum(Plane[] frustum, Vector3 point) {\n    foreach (Plane plane in frustum) {\n        if (Plane.HalfSpace(plane, point) &lt; 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nAnd finally you just use it in your render function for anything that you want to have culled:\nvoid Render() {\n    if (PointInFrustum(frustum, object.Position)) {\n      object.Render();\n    }\n}\n\nImplementation\nAs you can see above it&#39;s useful to make a Vector4 into a Plane, so lets add a new helper function to the Plane class to create one from a Vector:\npublic static Plane FromNumbers(Vector4 numbers) {\n    Plane p = new Plane();\n    p.n = new Vector3();\n    p.n.X = numbers.X;\n    p.n.Y = numbers.Y;\n    p.n.Z = numbers.Z;\n    p.d = numbers.W;\n    return p;\n}\n\nNext we need to make two member variables:\nPlane[] frustum = new Plane[6];\nfloat aspect = 0f;\n\nThe resason for frustum is pretty self explanatory, you need a frustum to do frustum culling. The aspect, not so much. We need an aspect ratio to recreate the projection matrix to extract planes from.\nAspect is actually already defined in the Resize function, take out the local definition of aspect from Resize so that it sets the value of the member variable.\nNow, we have an array of 6 Planes, but we do not have 6 planes. We only allocated the array. Let&#39;s allocate the actual planes in the Initialize function.\n... old code\nMouseState mouse = OpenTK.Input.Mouse.GetState();\nLastMousePosition = new Vector2(mouse.X, mouse.Y);\n// NEW\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i) {\n    frustum[i] = new Plane();\n}\n// OLD\nviewMatrix = Move3DCamera(0f);\n... old code\n\nNow that the actual planes have been created we have a frustum. Let&#39;s update the Move3DCamera function to populate this frustum. We&#39;re not going to take out any code (the near plane generation), we&#39;re just going to add new code to generate a frustum as well.\nAfter the cameraPlane (near plane) has been created, make a projection matrix, then use that to make a viewProjection matrix. Then, extract each row into a Vector4:\n... old code\ncameraPlane = Plane.ComputePlane(left, right, up);\n// NEW\nMatrix4 perspective = Matrix4.Perspective(60.0f, aspect, 0.01f, 1000.0f);\nMatrix4 mv =  perspective * cameraViewMatrix;\n\nVector4 row1 = new Vector4(mv[0, 0], mv[0, 1], mv[0, 2], mv[0, 3]);\nVector4 row2 = new Vector4(mv[1, 0], mv[1, 1], mv[1, 2], mv[1, 3]);\nVector4 row3 = new Vector4(mv[2, 0], mv[2, 1], mv[2, 2], mv[2, 3]);\nVector4 row4 = new Vector4(mv[3, 0], mv[3, 1], mv[3, 2], mv[3, 3]);\n\n... old code\n\nAfter we have those 4 rows calculating the camera planes becomes super simple, right after they where made, add this code to populate the frustum:\nfrustum[0] = Plane.FromNumbers(row4 + row1);\nfrustum[1] = Plane.FromNumbers(row4 - row1);\nfrustum[2] = Plane.FromNumbers(row4 + row2);\nfrustum[3] = Plane.FromNumbers(row4 - row2);\nfrustum[4] = Plane.FromNumbers(row4 + row3);\nfrustum[5] = Plane.FromNumbers(row4 - row3);\n\nNext, let&#39;s add a helper function to test if a point is inside the frustum:\npublic bool PointInFrustum(Plane[] frustum, Vector3 point) {\n    foreach (Plane plane in frustum) {\n        if (Plane.HalfSpace(plane, point) &lt; 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nAnd finally, we have to actually use this function in the Render function to determine what gets drawn and what does not:\nif (PointInFrustum(frustum, new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f))) {\n    GL.Color3(1f, 1f, 1f);\n    model.Render(true, false);\n}\nelse {\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Green susane culled&quot;);\n}\n\nThat&#39;s it. If you run the game now you should see susane, until the center point of the world goes off-screen.\nNon-Points\nYou might have noticed a flaw in all of this visibility optimization. With susane when the center of the world goes out of bounds (susanes position), she dissapears. But, really half of the geometry i still on screen.\nYou can imagine larger geometry will have MUCH more noticable poping. Generally we don&#39;t want this. I&#39;d rather an unseen object render than a seen object not render.\nThis is expected. To do proper Frustum Culling involves more math and primitive geometry testing. These topics are outside the realm of rendering, we will discuss them when we talk about scene management.\n"},"Chapter9/":{"url":"Chapter9/","title":"Advanced Topics","body":"Advanced\nFirst, this isn&#39;t the end of our OpenGL journey.

I decided to include a section on commonly used techniques, that you will not need to implement (this whole section is a read-along); but you should still know how they work.\nMost of these i have not implemented myself, but they come up in conversation.

Multitexturing isn&#39;t too expensive, it&#39;s mainly used to blend dirt and grass textures on terrains. Some lighting effects also use multitexturing.\nThe effect is mostly done by OpenGL, you just have to look up the right commands to issue, and the right order to issue them in. Here are some examples of multi texturing in action:\n\n\n"},"Chapter9/subtex.html":{"url":"Chapter9/subtex.html","title":"Sub Textures","body":"Sub Textures\nYou already know how to texture atlas. When you use an atlas you have a large image that&#39;s packed with smaller images. You access those images by modifying the uv coordinate that you draw.\nSub-Textures is almost the same thing. With sub-textures you can load sections of a texture as their own texture handles, essentially making them new textures.\nThis feature is mainly deamed to be useless, not many people use it. Especially for games.\n"},"Chapter9/bill.html":{"url":"Chapter9/bill.html","title":"Billboarding","body":"Billboarding\nBillboarding is a technique of making polygons always face the viewer. Why is this useful? Suppose we&#39;re making an outdoor scene. There are trees, LOTS of trees. They have LOTS of polygons. But far away trees have little detail to them. You could replace far away trees with textured quads that always face the camera.\nChanges are the player wouldn&#39;t even notice this. I can&#39;t, here is an example:\n\nIn some games all foliage may be billboarded:\n\nFlashes, Special FX, grenades and other objects are also good candidates for billboarding.\nMaking a billboard\nIf every object has a matrix, making a billboard is easy. When we did frustum culling we looked at how to extract the forward, right and up vectors from a matrix. Billboarding is mainly that.\nTake the cameras forward vector and invert it. Set the billboarded objects forward vector to this. We don&#39;t want the up axis of the billboard to change, but we do want to make sure that the right vector stays orthogonal. So take the billboards up and forward vectors and do a cross product. Set the billboards right vector to the result of the cross product.\n"},"Chapter9/normal.html":{"url":"Chapter9/normal.html","title":"Normal Mapping","body":"Normal Mapping\nNormal Mapping is a great way to add realism to any 3D model. Recall from when we learned about the lighting calculations in OpenGL that lighting is calculated on a per vertex level. This means the closer your vertices, the better the lights look.\nNormal mapping essentially encodes normal data into a texture (The R component of a pixel is the X component of the encoded normal, the G is the Y and the B is the Z). OpenGL then uses this texture with uv coordinates like normal textures, but instead of drawing the texture as a color, it uses it as a normal.\nThis gives us PER PIXEL normal mapping! By calculating the normals (and therefore light reflection) per pixel we can fake having detail on flat geometry.\n\nThis is a method we will implement when we learn about &quot;Modern OpenGL&quot;\n\n"},"Chapter9/specular.html":{"url":"Chapter9/specular.html","title":"Specular Mapping","body":"Specular Mapping\nSpecular Mapping is almost like normal mapping, but for the specular component. Becuase the specular component is just a single range value, the spec map is often added as the alpha channel of the normal map.\nAll specular mapping is is calculating the specular reflection of light per pixel. For example, here is a flat plane with a diffuse texture, normal map and specular map. Notice how it looks a little wet. That&#39;s because of the spec map:\n\n"},"Chapter9/ambient.html":{"url":"Chapter9/ambient.html","title":"Ambient Occlusion","body":"Ambient Occlusion\nAmbient Occlusion is the small shadows that ambient lighting casts. When you&#39;re in a well lit room look at the corner of a wall. It&#39;s usually a little bit darker than the rest of the wall. \nA better example is the wrinkles on a persons face. They cast suddle shadows. Because wrinkles are expressed using normal maps, there is no geometry for them to cast shadows. This is where ambient occlusion maps come into play. We basically render out all the suddle shadows, then apply them with a texture.\n\nAmbient maps look cool, they look like the scene is rendered into some solid dark white material. Modern games apply ambient occlusion maps to entire cities:\n\n"},"Chapter9/outlines.html":{"url":"Chapter9/outlines.html","title":"Outlines","body":"Outlines\nOutlines are a pretty classic effect in video games. Sometimes they are core to a games style, just look at borderlands:\n\nThe way borderlands does outlines is interesting, it&#39;s an old hack. First, you turn off Z-Write. Then you scale your model to 1.1 on all axis. Turn off texures and lighting, and render the model all black. Next, re-enable all the stuff that was disabled, and render the model normally at a scale of 1. The result is an outline!\nTo this day the above method is probably the fastest way to render an outline, but there are more precise ways to do it too. Sometimes you need precision! \nIf you need precise outlines you must have access to a models triangles. You have to have a list of edge objects, an edge is the line that connects two triangles. And you need a light direction. If the dot product of one of the triangles of an edge is &lt; 0, but the other is &gt; 0 then you know that edge is a part of the models outline.\n"},"Chapter9/proj_shadow.html":{"url":"Chapter9/proj_shadow.html","title":"Planar Shadows","body":"Planar Shadows\nPlanar shadows are the cheapest way to achieve &quot;nice&quot; looking shadows in games. They look OK, but they have a lot of artifacts. First, an object can not shadow it&#39;s-self. Second, the shadow is literally a plane, so if the player stands on an elevated surface, like a stump, the shadow will float.\nThis method was popular on the PS2 because of how cheap it is to implement performance wise. The method is simple, construct a special matrix that collapses your 3D geometry down onto a 2D plane. Render this collapsed version of the model black. This becomes the shadow. Then, render the model normally.\nThe extra matrix multiplication has minimal impact. The only challenging part of this method is finding the matrix that will project your 3D model onto a 2D plane in 3D space!\nI don&#39;t currently have this book with me, but OpenGL Game Programming covers how to derive the matrix.\nWe may or may not implement this shadowing method, i&#39;m not sure yet. It&#39;s kind of useless because of the artifacts it produces, and the next two shadowing methods we discuss both are capable of self-shadowing.\n"},"Chapter9/stencyl.html":{"url":"Chapter9/stencyl.html","title":"Stencyl Shadows","body":"Stencyl Shadows\nThis is perhaps the crispest way to implement shadows, it was made famous by DOOM3. Take a look at the detail of their shadow tech:\n\nStencyl shadows are also called volume shadows. To get a stencyl shadow you first find the outline of an object:\n\nOnce you have the outline, you must extrude it in the direction of the light. In theory this extrusion should be to infinity, but really it&#39;s just a really big number (50,000)\n\nThis extruded geometry is never rendered. What you do is test for intersections. Where this geometry instersects other geometry, you draw a shadow.\n\nAbove i peeled back the color to show where the shadow volume intersects the room geometry. Below is the final image. Notice how the shadow volume also covered half of the object casting the shadow, so the object is self shadowed\n\nStencyl?\nSo, why is this method called stencyl shadows? Well, you don&#39;t actually do any intersection testing. You &quot;Render&quot; the scene into the stencyl buffer (Not color buffer). Then you &quot;Render&quot; the shadow volume into the stencyl buffer too. \nIf you render the shadow volume and it draws on-top of other geometry we know an intersection happened.\nIt&#39;s a pretty complex topic, it took me about 5 years to actually implement. The best part is, no games actually use this method of shadowing anymore!\nAnyway, i wrote an article about it, with some sample c++ code: https://github.com/gszauer/GLExperiments/tree/master/ZFail\n"},"Chapter9/shadowmap.html":{"url":"Chapter9/shadowmap.html","title":"Shadow Mapping","body":"Shadow Mapping\nShadow mapping is the &quot;modern&quot; way to render shadows. The quality of shadow mapped shadows is MUCH lower than that of Stencyl Shadows, but performance wise shadow maps are MUCH faster. We will probably implement this method of shadowing later.\nThe concept of a shadow map is simple, render the entire scene into an off-screen color buffer from the point of view of the light. Then render the scene normally from the point of view of the camera. If the Z value of the camera pixel being rendered is closer than the Z value of the shadow pixel, the object is in shadow.\nShadow mapping suffers from resolution issues. Because the off screen buffer is just pixels, it can alias. A low resolution shadow map looks like crap!\nYou can find a really good tutorial on how to do shadow mapping with OpenGL 1 (Legacy OpenGL, what we&#39;ve been using) here, but it becomes MUCH easyer to implement with OpenGL 2.\nHere is an image comparing different resolution shadow maps.

Any racing game you play where the cars have some sort of real reflection on the paint, or any time you see a complex shape reflect something, it&#39;s a cubemap. \nA cubemapped reflection will look like this:\n\nSo, how to we achieve this effect? First the scene has to be rendered 6 times from the point of view of the object, into a cube map. If you remember, when we bind textures, one of the texture targets to bind to is CubeMap. This is what a rendered map will look like:\n\nNow comes the magic, when you render the object, OpenGL will take pixel color from the cube map. Imagine a cube that&#39;s just big enough to surroung the object being rendered (The green outline around the tea pot). The cube map is wrapped around this cube:\n\nNow when a pixel is rendered, OpenGL figures out what direction the light on that pixel reflects from, and casts a ray out. Wherever that ray hits the enclosing cube, that pixel is used for the color of the object.\nThis is a super advanced graphics method, that i&#39;ve never had to implement. Mainly because engines like Unity do the hard work for you, you just have to tag an object as cube-map refected.

Other systems emit billboarded quads, or like our implementation just simple quads.\nParticles are used to create anything from rain, fog, fire to waterfalls and the such.

OpenGL has something called an accumulation buffer. You can store the color buffer from the last N frames (N can be any number depending on your GPU support, the OpenGL specs guarantee it will at least be 3) and blend them together. \nBlending the last 3 to 8 frames causes them to look blured. You can render everything blured, or use the stencyl buffer to render some things not blured at all. OR you could render things from your scene (Not blured) at 80% oppacity to make them look kind of blurred, but less so than the rest of the scene.\n"},"Chapter9/terrains.html":{"url":"Chapter9/terrains.html","title":"Terrains","body":"Terrain\nTerrain&#39;s are created using height maps.

Well you have a black and white image. White areas represent low height and black areas represent tall height. Then you have a large, subdivided plane. You map each vertex of the plane to a pixel on the height-map. You set the Y position of each vertex to whatever the heightmap wants you to set it to.\n\n\nAs you can imagine, outdoor games like Skyrim or Far Cry use this method a lot.
