#Full Screen
Most games have the ability to switch between full screen mode and windowed mode. A lot of times this is implemented as a menu option. It used to be standard to toggle fullscreen mod with the ```Alt+Enter shortcut```, however that trent has been slowly dying out. 

How you want to implement your fullscreen toggle logic is up to you, i'm just going to show you how to actually toggle. If you end up accidentally going into fullscreen mode press ```Alt+Tab``` to bring up the program selection toolbox. Navigate to Visual studio (Keep alt pressed down while tapping the tab button to move between programs) and use the red square to terminate the application.
